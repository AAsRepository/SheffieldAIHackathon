Our legal deadline was 8 October 2024. We\nsincerely apologise for our breach of Regulation 5(2) to communicate the\ninformation to you \u2018as soon as possible, and no later than 20 working days\nafter the date of receipt of the request.\u2019 The responsibility lay solely\nwith the FOI team. Our Inbox is very busy, but we are acutely aware of our\nlegal obligations and are striving to improve our compliance rate.\nThere were two elements to your request:\nPlease provide me with copies of all internal correspondence about the\nprocessing of my Freedom of Information request of Freedom of Information\nRequest\u201d FOI/EIR Request Regarding Claim of Turret Collapse at the Market\nTavern on 10 January\u201d .\nRecords will in include but not be limited to, those of the FOI team\nreaching out to record custodians, record custodians discussing their\nstatutory response, any advice sought, and the responses received after a\nsearch for records was complete.\nPlease find attached.\nThe requester is also interested in the statement \u201cIt is the intention of\nthe council to publish the outcome of this investigation.\u201d as stated in\nthe council\u2019s initial response. The requester would also like to have\nsight of any recorded information for the basis of this statement in the\nresponse.\nOur statement was made on 6 March 2024 in response to your initial request\nof 7 February 2024. In that response, which we refused on the grounds that\nthere was a live investigation into the circumstances around the\ndemolition of the fa\u00e7ade of the Market Tavern, we made the statement\nabove. Please find attached an email from the Director of Human Resources\nupon which this statement was based. We know that this email is dated 6\nJune 2024, i.e., three months after we replied to you. We cannot find any\nprevious recorded information in our files. However, our statement\nreflected the council\u2019s position at the time.\nWe have withheld personal data in our attachments. Personal data relates\nto identifiable staff, by name and job role. Section 40(2) of FOIA\nprovides that information is exempt from disclosure if it is the personal\ndata of an individual other than the requester and where one of the\nconditions listed in section 40(3A)(a) is satisfied. This applies where\nthe disclosure of the information to any member of the public would\ncontravene any of the principles relating to the processing of personal\ndata (the DP principles), as set out in Article 5 of the UK General Data\nProtection Regulation (UKGDPR).\nArticle 5(1)(a) of the UK GDPR states that: \u201cPersonal data shall be\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the\ndata subject\u201d. In the case of an FOIA request, the personal data is\nprocessed when it is disclosed in response to the request. This means that\nthe information can only be disclosed if to do so would be lawful, fair\nand transparent. In order to be lawful, one of the lawful bases listed in\nArticle 6(1) of the GDPR must apply to the processing. It must also be\ngenerally lawful.\nArticle 6(1) of the UK GDPR specifies the requirements for lawful\nprocessing by providing that \u201cprocessing shall be lawful only if and to\nthe extent that at least one of the\u201d conditions listed in the Article\napplies. One of the conditions in Article 6(1) must therefore be met\nbefore disclosure of the information in response to the request would be\nconsidered lawful.\nThe Council considers that the lawful basis most applicable is basis\n6(1)(f) which states: \u201cprocessing is necessary for the purposes of the\nlegitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party except\nwhere such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights\nand freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal\ndata, in particular where the data subject is a child\u201d.\nThe Council considers that the lawful basis most likely to be relevant in\nrelation to a request for information under the FOIA is Article 6(1)(f);\nlegitimate interests. In considering the application of this provision in\nthe context of a request for information under FOIA it is necessary to\nconsider the following three-part test:\ni. Legitimate interest test: Whether a legitimate interest is being\npursued in the request for information;\nIn considering any legitimate interests in the disclosure of the requested\ninformation under the FOIA, we recognise that such interests can include\nbroad general principles of accountability and transparency for their own\nsakes as well as case specific interests. Further, a wide range of\ninterests may be legitimate interests. They can be the requester\u2019s own\ninterests or the interests of third parties, and commercial interests as\nwell as wider societal benefits. They may be compelling or trivial, but\ntrivial interests may be more easily overridden.\nA disclosure under FOI is a disclosure to the world.\nWe do not consider the disclosure of the names of staff are a legitimate\ninterest. The staff act for Sheffield City Council and are accountable for\ntheir actions as set out under their contract of employment and supporting\nHR policies. Matters relating to staff conduct and performance are an\ninternal matter. Disclosure to the world must avoid unjustified adverse\neffects on the employees concerned. These staff have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nAs there is no legitimate interest, we have not gone on to conduct the\nNecessity test nor the Balancing test.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
