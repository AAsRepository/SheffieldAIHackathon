The reference number for your\nrequest can be found above. We apologise for responding so long after the\nlegal deadline. This was an oversight on our part.\nYou requested: The number of vehicles reported as abandoned within your\narea, broken down by year across the last year (from September 2022 to\nSeptember 2023). If possible, please also include the make and model and\nregistration year of any of these abandoned vehicles\nOur response: The number of abandoned vehicles reported in the time period\nrequested was 1896. Because of how our data is held we are not able to\nextract from it the other information about the make/model or registration\nyear for the vehicle. Someone would have to manually open each record and\nrecord that detail which for this number of reports would be a significant\nundertaking. Allowing 3-5 minutes per record, this would take between 90\nand 158 hours to complete.
