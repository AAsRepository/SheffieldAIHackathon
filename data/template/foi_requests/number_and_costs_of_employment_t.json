                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nPlease could you provide the following, in the form of a spreadsheet, in respect of teachers at any school maintained by Sheffield City Council, for a period of the past five years (Jan 1 2018 - February 28 2024), broken down year by year if possible:\n1. The number of teachers who have launched employment tribunal proceedings against their employer (ie. The maintained school, its Executive Board, the council, etc)\n2. The number of these cases that ended in an out-of-court cash settlement\n3. The sum total of those cash settlements (I do not believe this would breach any non-disclosure agreements as it does not reveal how much any one individual received)\n4. How many teachers have signed Non-disclosure agreements in respect of their employment tribunals?\nYours faithfully,\nAlastair Ulke"

                "Dear FOI team,\nThank your for taking the time for that explanation.\nI'm happy to accept that the numbers are low enough year-on-year that it could help someone identify the teachers in particular cases.\nMy enquiry initially asked for a year-by-year breakdown of the past five years. Would the information be more anonymised if I did not ask for this and just asked for a summary of the past five years? If the number of cases in the past five years is low enough still as to be identifiable, could I increase the number of years in the range? Hopefully there is an acceptable spot where the number of cases compared to the number of years covered makes it so teachers cannot be singled out.\nThank you for your time, best wishes,\nAlastair Ulke"
