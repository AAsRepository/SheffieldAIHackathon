                "Dear Sarah Lockwood,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Personal Budgets in\nEducation 2025 which we received on 18/01/2025.\nWe apologise for the delay in providing a response. Please find Sheffield\nCity Council\u2019s response to your request set out below:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many children/young people within your Local Authority with\nan EHCP have no school or setting named in Section I of their Plan (as at\nJan 25)?\nOn 28^th January 2025, there were 24 pupils listed as \u2018Pupil Not on Roll\u2019.\nThese numbers will, however, include pupils who do have a setting named in\nsection I, but are not attending the setting due to several possible\nfactors.\nAt the point of finalising an EHCP, there are occasions when a setting\n\u2018type\u2019 is named in Section I while the LA works to secure an appropriate\nplacement. A pupil may continue to attend their current setting, until a\ntransition into a new setting can be arranged. In this instance, their new\nEHCP would contain only a setting \u2018type\u2019 in Section I, and not a named\nsetting. This information is recorded only within their E-File, not within\nan information management system. On 28^th January 2025, there were 6246\nPupils with a SEN Status E in the city. It takes an average of 1 minute to\nlocate the E-File and record the information in section I. It would\ntherefore take more than 100 hours to conclusively determine the answer to\nthis question.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many children/young people within your Local Authority with\nan EHCP are registered as being electively home educated (as at Jan 25)?\n51\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many children/young people within your Local Authority with\nan EHCP are registered as EOTAS/EOTIS/EOTIC (Educated Otherwise Than In a\nSchool or College as per Section 61 of the Children & Families Act 2014)\n(as at Jan 25)\n56\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many children/young people within your Local Authority have\nbeen awarded and currently access Personal Budgets for Education (as at\nJan 25)?\n65\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many of the Personal Budgets for Education currently\naccessed have been provided as part of an Education Otherwise Than At/In\nSchool or College (EOTAS(C)/EOTIS(C)) provision described in their\nEducation Health and Care Plan (as at Jan 25)?\n31\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many of the Personal Budgets for Education currently\naccessed have been awarded to children/young people who are being\nElectively Home Educated (EHE) (as at Jan 25)?\n0\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many of the Personal Budgets for Education currently being\naccessed are awarded in the form of Direct Payments to families (as at Jan\n25)?\n65\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the total annual cost of Personal Budgets for Education\nwithin your Local Authority (as at Jan 25)?\n\u00a3497,206.00\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the total annual cost of Personal Budgets for Education\nallocated as Direct Payments to families within your Local Authority (as\nat Jan 25)?\n\u00a3497,206.00\nData Captured 28.01.2025\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
