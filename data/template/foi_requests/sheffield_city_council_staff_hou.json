This could include staff for whom it is the entirety of their\nrole as well as staff who are working on it alongside other duties\nthough I would like to request that these two differentiated in the\nresponse if possible.\nSeven full time staff members were allocated to this work, for varying\nlengths of time with 6 part time staff allocated to this work for varying\nlengths of time. Please note that these 6 part time staff members include\n2 full time staff members who split their time across other areas of work,\nand we have therefore considered them part time for this work. In total,\nwe had a flexible programme team of 13 people throughout the delivery from\nAugust 21 to July 22, with people phasing in/out depending on requirement.\n2.\u00a0How many staff hours did the council assign to the implementation of\nthe committee system? This could include staff for whom it is the\nentirety of their role as well as staff who are working on it\nalongside other duties though I would like to request that these two\ndifferentiated in the response if possible.\nThis has been worked out by calculating the weeks between the individuals\nstart and end dates on this work and multiplying this by their individual\nallocation figures. Please note, this does not account for days of annual\nleave, sickness, the holiday break and also doesn\u2019t factor in any further\nnuance such as shorter or longer working days. As we have done this by\nweeks allocated, this does broadly account for when the individuals phased\nin/out of the work. These figures should only be considered a high-level\nestimate.\nStaff Member Allocation Approx Hours\nPart Time 532.8\nProject Managers Full Time 1006.4\nFull Time 1006.4\nFull Time 1124.8\nFull Time 1006.4\nPart Time 603.84\nBusiness Analysts Part Time 805.12\nFull Time 355.2\nFull Time 769.6\nCommunications Part Time 251.6\nPart Time 402.56\nProgramme Management Full Time 1272.8\nOfficer\nProgramme Manager Part Time 962\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
