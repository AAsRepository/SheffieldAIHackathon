                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI'm looking to ascertain how much money is spent on profit making organisations in the areas of 4-19 SEND education and (separately) fostering, children's home or secure accommodation placements.\nI recognise that this request may be rejected if the information requested is too specific, therefore I have made the request on a number of levels. Please complete as many as you are able to within the constraints of the Act.\n1. Please confirm whether you pay Cambian Group and/or Witherslack Group for services in SEND education (4-19) and/or fostering, children's home or secure accommodation placements. This can be a simple Yes/No answer for each organisation. Please also detail the number of children and young people, ideally divided by each organisation and by SEND education (4-19) and/or fostering, children's home or secure accommodation placements. If this is too sensitive/onerous, please simply break the number down by number of children and young people receiving SEND education (4-19) and/or fostering, children's home or secure accommodation placements\n2. Please detail the amount of money spent in the last two financial years with for profit providers of SEND education (4-19) and fostering, children's home or secure accommodation placements. Please provide this in a spreadsheet split out between SEND and education and fostering, children's home or secure accommodation. If this is too onerous, I will accept one year's spend\n3. If any of the above is too onerous, I will settle for confirmation of whether the authority uses Cambian Group and/or Witherslack Group and an overall figure for spend on all for profit providers of all of the services outlined above.\nThank you for your time and attention in this matter.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Dye"
