Information request FOI 886890. We apologise for the significant delay in responding. This was caused partly by the backlog of requests we are dealing with, but also the large quantity of material in scope. We are now able to answer your request in full.\nYou have requested:\na) A list of all event that the Lord Mayor or Deputy Lord Mayor attended (in their official capacity) including dates, times and venues.\nb) A list of all events that the Lord Mayor or Deputy Lord Mayor hosted (in their official capacity) including dates, times and venues.\nc) the costs of events hosted by the Lord Mayor or their deputy for each office holder for each year.\nd) the cost of providing the official car (including, but not limited to, repairs and maintenance, fuel and driver(s)) for each year.\nWe have supplied (19/10/2023) the answers to your questions (c) and (d) regarding the cost of events and the official car. We are now providing the redacted diary sheets for the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor for the period 2019-2023, covering the tenure of Cllr Tony Downing, Cllr Gail Smith and Cllr Sioned-Mair Richards. We are sending this in three batches. This email includes Cllr Downing's tenure. There are two more batches to follow.\nPersonal data has been redacted under section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on the grounds that it is personal data and disclosure would contravene the data protection principle under Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation that processing of personal data must be fair, lawful and transparent. This includes the names and contact details of members of the public and third parties contained within the record, for example, the names and addresses of individuals whose birthdays were celebrated.\nThe Information Commissioner\u2019s Office has produced guidance on the redaction of staff names when responding to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004. This guidance advises that decisions whether to disclose staff names should be taken on a case-by-case basis, but relevant factors to consider include the seniority of the staff involved and whether the staff have a reasonable expectation that their names will be released. Our usual policy is not to release the names of staff below Head of Service level, which takes into account that staff have the reasonable expectation that their names would not be released in a disclosure to the world.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be found here\nhttps://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/...\n. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council requires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains public sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your request, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an internal review by replying to this email. Internal review requests should be submitted within 40 working days from the date of this response.\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you can contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. Please see\nhttps://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/offi...\nfor further details.\nKind Regards,\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [Sheffield City Council request email]\nshow quoted sections"
