Only if\npayment for the actual day of use is not made, is the Council notified by\nthe online system of the contravention so that a PCN can be issued once\ndetails are available of the registered keeper.\nThere are advance warning and repeated signs on the approach to the Clean\nAir Zone to notify motorists of the enforcement of CAZ and to check online\nfor more information. There is also an interactive map on the Sheffield\nCity Council website for motorists to check its boundary, along with other\ninformation - [1]\nhttps://www.sheffield.gov.uk/clean-air-z...\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
