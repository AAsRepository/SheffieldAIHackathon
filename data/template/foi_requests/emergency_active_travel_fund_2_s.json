We accept your complaint about our\nfailure to respond to your original request of 22 May 2023 for information\nabout the Emergency Active Travel Fund 2, Shoreham Street.

We\nhad the information available to send you on 27 June 2023. But it was\noverlooked due to our workload. We sincerely apologise for this lapse on\nour part and hope you have not been too inconvenienced by the delay.\nPlease find below our response to your request:\nA. Any Road Safety Audits undertaken in relation to the Shoreham Street\nelement of recent EATF2 works. Do not include the Cherry Street filter\nwithin this request.\nWe are happy to share the Road Safety Audit (RSA) once the response to it\nhas been signed off. The main issue in the corridor is getting cyclists\nsafely from the (proposed new) bi-directional cycling route on the (inside\nthe Ring Road) section of Shoreham Street across to Matilda Street, so\ncyclists can continue towards the City centre. We are withholding the RSA\nunder the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, specifically\nRegulation 12(4)(d) - Material in the course of completion, unfinished\ndocuments, and incomplete data. The public interest in disclosure is\ntransparency. The public interest in withholding the Audit at this time is\nthat there is time for the information to be checked before it is made\npublic and that the timetable properly requires internal consideration of\nthe information prior to its public release. On balance, the Council\nbelieves that the public interest lies in maintaining the exception.
