                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI would like to know how much each Primary, Secondary and SEND school in the LEA (of which data is held) has spent on Supply Teaching or Teaching Assistant cover with external supply agency companies, and if possible how much has been spent with each of those companies per school. If this information is unavailable, then just a total spend by school.\nI would like this data to cover the previous academic year from the 1st September 2023 - 31st July 2024.\nYours faithfully,\nLuke"
