                "Dear Madam/Sir,\nMy name is Immanuel Feld and I am a researcher at the University of Warwick. My research focusses on local governments and the provision of public goods. I am thus interested in collecting information on the public libraries run by local councils.\nSpecifically, under the FOI legislation, I request a list of all public libraries run by your council between 2005 and 2022. Additionally, could you please provide information on dates of opening and closure (with at least year-month precision) if they started or ceased operation over that period. Lastly, could you please provide information on opening and closing hours of the library in that given year?\nThat means the final dataset would have the following columns:\nName of the library, address, date of opening, date of closing, opening hours in year 2005, opening hours in year 2006, \u2026 , opening hours in year 2022.\nIf collecting daily opening hours is not possible, annual opening hours are sufficient, too.\nI am happy with whatever format of the data is the most suitable to you and I don\u2019t have any issue in combining multiple files.\nYours faithfully,\nImmanuel Feld"
