All with the support of the residents after several\nmeetings. We now have more highway trees in Shiregreen than we have ever had, more varieties and more suitable for our street environment\nand in more suitable places. Some of the very large trees which left many homes in permanent shadow and damaged the pavements have been replaced, much to\nsatisfaction of the residents. Rather than calling for the resignation of Councillors Fox and Lodge Iwould like to thank them for all the work done on the Shiregreen estate.\u201d\n1. Can the council indicate: how many trees were felled on the Shiregreen Estate by Amey, and the number of replacements.\n2. Could you please provide details, dates and and copy of the invitation/notice of these several meetings.\n3. Could the council indicate in the Shiregreen Estate as referred to by Peter Price how many Trees were damaging the pavement? And that were replaced, please supply asset IDs for all identified.\nYours faithfully,\nMarcus"
