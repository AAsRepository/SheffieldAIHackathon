                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nThe Off-payroll legislation was introduced in Chapter 10 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, with the new legislation going live from April 6th 2017. This new legislation overrode, in the public sector, the existing Intermediaries Legislation (Chapter 8, ITEPA).\nThe new legislation is here:\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/201...\nAround July 2018 HMRC sent your body a letter asking for information related to \u201cChecking compliance with the rules from April 2017\u201d\nFor easy identification, a copy of the letter is as follows:\n-- Letter start --\nOff Payroll Reform in the Public Sector\nSection 61M Chapter 10 ITEPA 22003 and Regulation 13 Social Security (Miscellaneous Amendments No.) Regulations 2017\nFollowing the introduction of chapter 10 ITEPA 2003 and certain amendments to chapter 8 ITEPA 2003 (\u201cIR35\u201d), new rules apply in relation to off-payroll working in the public sector from 6 April 207. Where individuals work and are paid through their own intermediary, public authorities as defined in the legislation) are now responsible for deciding whether the rules apply. Where a person is assessed as being with the new rules, the public authority agencies and third parties paying the fee for the services of the worker must operate tax, NICs and operate the Apprenticeship Levy.\nI would like to check your compliance with the new legislation, including any systems you have introduced to help you decide whether the offpayroll rules should apply when engaging workers via their own intermediary (either directly or via an agency or other labour provider). Such an intermediary will often be a \u2018personal service company\u2019, but as the legislation also applies where a worker is engaged via a partnership or another person, I will use the terms \u2018PSC or other intermediary\u2019 and \u2018PSC etc\u2019 in this letter.\nI have listed the information we need below and would be grateful for your response by 31 August 2018. If the amount of information I have requested will make this difficult, please contact me to discuss how this can be managed.\nChecking compliance with the rules from April 2017\n1.\tPlease describe the steps you took prior to April 2017:\ni.\tto review the off-payroll engagement of PSCs or other intermediaries, to decide whether the off-payroll rules would apply\nii.\tplease include an explanation of any different or additional steps taken in relation to PSCs etc that you engaged via an agency or other labour provider.\n2.\tIf different from 1 above, please describe the systems / processes currently in place to decide whether the off-payroll rules apply to PSCs etc, whether you engage them directly or via an agency or other labour provider.

Do you have any policy in place that encourages the use of umbrella companies for those found to be within the rules?\n6.\tFor those not working through umbrella companies, have any workers that previously worked through their own PSC etc subsequently entered into employment contracts with your group?\n7.\tThe offpayroll rules do not apply where a public authority has fully contracted out servicces to a third party e.g. an outsourcing company operating under a contract where the workers do not personally provide their services to the public authority. If you believe this applies to you, please provide an explanation for the affected contract(s).\nMore information about the check\nI enclose factsheet CC/FS1c \u2018General information about compliance checks into certain large and complex businesses\u2019. Please take time to read this, it gives you more information about this type of check.
