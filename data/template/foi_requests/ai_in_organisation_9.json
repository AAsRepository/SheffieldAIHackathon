                "Dear Laura Riley,\nThank you for your request for information relating to AI in organisation\nwhich we received on 28/06/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1.\u00a0The number of your current job descriptions that include the use of\n\"AI/artificial intelligence\" as a skill, requirement, or desirable\nattribute.\nSheffield City Council currently have no job descriptions that list\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) as a skill, requirement or desirable\nattribute. We are in the process of developing two new job descriptions\nthat will reference AI, but these have not yet gone through internal\nreview processes. These roles are Automation Lead and Enterprise\nArchitect.\n2.\u00a0Details about how your organisation is currently utilising artificial\nintelligence. Specifically, I am interested in the projects or tasks\nwhere AI is employed.\nSheffield City Council currently uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for a\nlimited range of tasks predominantly relating to image recognition. This\nincludes automatic number plate recognition for managing bus lanes and the\nClean Air Zone. We have also recently started a test for change with\nwilling social care users, which involves the use of Internet of Things\n(IoT) sensors by our partners. The data from these sensors is amalgamated\nand analysed using AI to help identify where a proactive and preventative\nhealth or social care intervention may be required such as in the\nprevention of falls.\nWe do have access to corporate AI technology in the form of \u2018AI Builder\u2019,\nwhich is part of Microsoft\u2019s Power Platform. We are not currently using AI\nBuilder for any \u2018live\u2019 tasks, projects or processes, it has only been used\nin development environments to help us better understand the capabilities\nof the technology. We have implemented the Power Platform Centre of\nExcellence suite to enable us to monitor and control any use of this AI\ntool.\nHowever, we acknowledge that there are open AI technologies (like ChatGPT)\nthat employees are experimenting with, that are more difficult to monitor\nhow they are used. We do not believe that open AI is being used in any\nformal tasks or projects, but are seeking to ensure appropriate oversight\nand governance is in place through the development of a Responsible AI\nPolicy.\n3.\u00a0Information regarding whether there is a dedicated team within your\norganisation focused on the implementation or management of AI\ntechnologies.\nAny AI technologies will be implemented and managed by the ICT & Digital\nInnovation Service, working in collaboration with other services. The\nTechnical Design Authority (TDA) will also review AI technologies before\nthey are implemented.\n4.\u00a0Any available information on planned future uses of AI within your\norganisation.\nWe are currently developing a Responsible AI Policy that will define how\nAI can be used ethically, responsibly and safely with Sheffield City\nCouncil. We will also develop a Digital Strategy that outlines a roadmap\nfor how AI could provide better customer experience and operational\nefficiencies. Areas of potential exploration may include document reading\n(such as invoices), IoT and chatbots.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
