                "1 Attachment\nFOI 2022 23 852 Emails Redacted.pdf\n447K\nDownload\nView as HTML\nDear Mr Buxton\nThank you for your request for information about the Bevan Brittan\nEvaluation Report, which we received on 22 October 2022. We apologise that\nwe did not meet the deadline of 19 December 2022, following our extension\nof 21 November 2022 to apply the public interest test.\nYou asked:\n1.\u00a0When did Bevan Brittan LLP report their findings to SCC?\nWe received their provisional findings on 16 February 2022, and a final\nreport on 10 August 2022.\n2. Please provide any and all data held, associated in anyway with the\ndissemination to the public of this report/findings.\nPlease find attached.\nWe have withheld the names of some senders and recipients of emails and\ncontact details under Section 40(2) which exempts information in response\nto a request if it is personal data belonging to another individual, and\nit satisfies one of the conditions listed in the legislation. The\ncondition contained in section 40(3A)(a) applies that disclosure would\nbreach one of the data protection principles. The principle is that,\n\u201cPersonal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent\nmanner...\u201d We do not consider that disclosing this information to you, and\nconsequently the public, is necessary or justified in order to satisfy\nyour information request and the requirements of the FOIA. In the\ncircumstances of this request there is no strong legitimate interest that\nwould override the prejudice to the rights and freedoms of the data\nsubjects. We have therefore taken the decision that disclosing this\ninformation to you would be unlawful.\nWe believe that the information we are providing is exempt under section\n36 because it is information which would likely prejudice the conduct of\npublic affairs. The exemption requires the application of the public\ninterest test. The purpose of the public interest test is to decide\nwhether the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the\npublic interest in disclosure. The public interest in disclosure is\ntransparency. The public interest in maintaining the exemption is the\n\u201csafe space\u201d for officers to consider all aspects of the issue\nconfidentially. The council [1]published the report on 5 December 2022. We\ndo not consider that maintaining the exemption outweighs the public\ninterest in disclosure.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [2]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an\ninternal review by replying to this email. Internal review requests should\nbe submitted within 40 working days from the date of this response.\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you\ncan contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.
