We sincerely apologise for this lapse on our part and hope you\nhave not been too inconvenienced by the delay.\nWe confirmed with Active Travel England they were happy for us to share\nour bid documents publicly. We are attaching the addendum, but the main\nproposal (204 pages) and the community engagement strategy (42 pages)\nretain the names of the three consultants, which we need to redact.
