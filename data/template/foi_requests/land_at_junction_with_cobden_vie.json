                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nWork has begun to clear land north of Cobden View Road (planning ref: 22/00723/FUL).\nOne of the conditions of approval was that before any work commences: a walkover of the site shall be undertaken by a qualified ecologist to ensure that the development would not disturb any nesting birds or other wildlife which may have moved onto the site. The findings\nof the walkover shall be submitted in writing to the Local Planning Authority and\nany necessary mitigation works carried out.\nHas this been carried out and can the findings be published?\nYours faithfully,\nHamish"
