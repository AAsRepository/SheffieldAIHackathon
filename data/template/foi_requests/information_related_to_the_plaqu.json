We hope these are not difficult\nto follow: inevitably there is some repetition within email\ncorrespondence.\nSome of the information within the documents is exempt from disclosure\nunder section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on the grounds\nthat it is personal data and disclosure would contravene the data\nprotection principle under Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection\nRegulation that processing of personal data must be fair, lawful and\ntransparent. This includes the names, contact details and personal\nopinions of people within the correspondence.\nThe names of some staff have been redacted, following the Information\nCommissioner\u2019s [1]guidance on the redaction of staff names when responding\nto requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000/ Environmental\nInformation Regulations 2004. This guidance advises that decisions whether\nto disclose staff names should be taken on a case-by-case basis, but\nrelevant factors to consider include the seniority of the staff involved\nand whether the staff have a reasonable expectation that their names will\nbe released. Our usual policy is not to release the names of staff below\nHead of Service level, which takes into account that staff have the\nreasonable expectation that their names would not be released in a\ndisclosure to the world.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [2]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed.
