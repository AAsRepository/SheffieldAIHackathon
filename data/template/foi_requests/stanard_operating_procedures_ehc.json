Therefore there are two decision making\npoints for each case in line with the SEND Code of Practice.\n2. What the process is for services if a parent makes a request under\nregulation 6.1(h).\n\u2022\u00a0For such requests the Local Authority would decide whether the request\nwas reasonable. If it was then a notification letter would be sent. If\nthe request was not considered reasonable the parents would be\ninformed of this.\n3. How many weeks into the process do you make a decision whether to do an\nassessment or not.\n\u2022\u00a0When a request is received it is heard at panel the following week.\nThe case can return to panel until all appropriate information is\nreceived. A decision is always made by the 6 week date in line with\nthe SEND Code of Practice.\n4. How many weeks into the process do you make a decision whether to do an\nissue a Plan or not.\n\u2022\u00a0The Local Authority aims to make a decision by week 12.\n5. How many weeks into the process do you send the draft to families?\n\u2022\u00a0The draft is sent to the family between weeks 12 and 16.\n6. How many weeks into the process do you inform families about any\nprocesses regarding school requests.\n\u2022\u00a0This information is shared with the family at the same time as the\ndecision to issue a plan.\nCould you also tell me for financial year 2022/23 how much was spent on\nappeals, how many appeals were brought and how many times the LA\nsuccessfully defended an appeal at a hearing.\n\u2022\u00a0Number of appeals \u2013 118, 2 parental appeals have been rejected.\nAmount spent 2022/23 - \u00a3169,410.90\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
