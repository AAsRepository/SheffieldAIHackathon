                "Dear Russell Johnson,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Information on\nCouncil expenditure on Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) which we received\non 09/04/2024.\nAcas explains that a non-disclosure agreement might be used after a\ndispute which results in someone leaving a job, to keep details\nconfidential. That duty of confidentiality applies to both parties,\nemployer, and former employee. The disclosure of amounts and numbers is\nconfidential. One couldn\u2019t selectively disclose one amount or all amounts\nbecause that would be a breach of the agreement so signed. You might\nconsider that there is also a public interest in matters settling without\ntaking up tribunal time.\u00a0 That is encouraged by the courts and these types\nof agreement are a common way of meeting that public interest. If both we\nand the other parties thought that an FOI would result in the Council not\nabiding by the agreements, then less cases would settle.\nUnder section 1(1) of Freedom of Information Act 2000 anyone who requests\ninformation from a public authority is entitled under subsection (a) to be\ntold if the authority holds the requested information \u2013 this is referred\nto as the duty to confirm or deny.\nHowever, section 40(5B)(a)(i) of FOIA allows the council to refuse to\nconfirm or deny that it holds information if the mere act of confirming\n(or denying) that information is held would reveal personal data about an\nidentifiable individual and would contravene one of the data protection\nprinciples.\nThe two main elements of personal data are that the information must\nrelate to a living person and that the person must be identifiable.\nAn identifiable living individual is one who can be identified, directly\nor indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an\nidentification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or\nmore factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,\neconomic, cultural, or social identity of the individual.\nInformation will relate to a person if it is about them, linked to them,\nhas biographical significance for them, is used to inform decisions\naffecting them or has them as its focus.\nThe council considers that confirming or denying whether the information\nis held constitutes the disclosure to the wider world of third-party\npersonal data. If the council confirmed whether it held information within\nscope of the request it would, in effect, confirm whether staff who left\nemployment in the past three years covered by the scope of the request\nsigned an NDA.\nFurther, if the council confirmed or denied it held information, it would,\nin effect, confirm whether staff who left the council received\nsettlements.\nOn the face of it, the requested information does not directly identify\nany individual(s). However, it would be possible to identify individual(s)\nbecause it would be known amongst staff, who had left departments in the\nlast three years, where their circumstances were not clear.\nThe council has considered whether the information, when combined with\nother information either already in the public domain via personal\nknowledge or the grapevine, or known to other people working, may\nnevertheless make identification possible.\nThe council is satisfied that confirming or denying that the information\nis held constitutes the disclosure of personal data as specific\nindividuals could be identified and it would disclose whether those\nindividuals had signed an NDA or received a settlement.\nThe council has next considered whether confirming or denying that the\ninformation is held would contravene one of the data protection\nprinciples.\nIn the case of a FOIA request, the personal data is processed when it is\ndisclosed in response to the request. This means that the information can\nonly be disclosed \u2013 or as in this case, the council can only confirm\nwhether or not it holds the requested information - if to do so would be:\na. lawful (i.e. it would meet one of the conditions of lawful processing\nlisted in Article 6(1) UK GDPR); b. fair; and c. transparent.\nTo be lawful, one of the lawful bases listed in Article 6(1) of the UK\nGDPR must apply to the processing. It must also be lawful. In considering\nany legitimate interest(s) in the disclosure of the requested information\nunder FOIA, or confirmation or denial that it is held, the council\nrecognises that a wide range of interests may be legitimate interests.\nThey can be the requester\u2019s own interests or the interests of third\nparties, and commercial interests as well as wider societal benefits.\nThese interest(s) can include broad general principles of accountability\nand transparency for their own sakes, as well as case specific interests.\nThe council considers that any individuals who may have been involved have\na strong and reasonable expectation that personal information about them\nwill remain confidential in accordance with data protection laws.\nWe understand the interest of citizens. But we must consider whether the\ndisclosure is necessary. \u2018Necessary\u2019 means more than desirable but less\nthan indispensable or absolute necessity. Accordingly, the test is one of\nreasonable necessity and involves consideration of alternative measures\nwhich may make disclosure of the requested information unnecessary.\nDisclosure under FOIA must therefore be the least intrusive means of\nachieving the legitimate aim in question.\nThe council appreciates that there is a public interest. However, there is\nalso a public interest in upholding standard practice in HR matters, which\nis to observe a duty of confidentiality. The council has therefore decided\nin this case that confirmation or denial is not necessary to meet the\nlegitimate interest in disclosure. As confirmation or denial is not\nnecessary, there is no lawful basis for this processing, and it is\nunlawful.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.

                "Dear Mr Johnson,\nYou have asked us for an internal review of your request on 9^th May 2024.\nThis has now been carried out and our detailed response is below. This was\ncarried out by a member of the FOI team from 13^th \u2013 21^st May 2024. Text\nthat forms part of our original response is shown in blue, to aid\nunderstanding.\nYour Request Received 9/4/2024\nPlease provide the following information.\nIn connection with NDAs or similarly binding legal or quasi-legal\nagreements with departing SCC staff:\nThe total cost figures for the financial years 21-22, 22-23 and 23-24;\nThe number of staff (no names required) benefiting from such payments in\neach of those years; The maximum single payment in each of the years.\nOur Response Sent 8/5/2024\nWe replied, citing section 40(5B)(a)(i) of FOIA which allows the council\nto refuse to confirm or deny that it holds information if the mere act of\nconfirming (or denying) that information is held would reveal personal\ndata about an identifiable individual and would contravene one of the data\nprotection principles.\nFurther explanation, given in our response:\nThe council considers that confirming or denying whether the information\nis held constitutes the disclosure to the wider world of third-party\npersonal data. If the council confirmed whether it held information within\nscope of the request it would, in effect, confirm whether staff who left\nemployment in the past three years covered by the scope of the request\nsigned an NDA.\nFurther, if the council confirmed or denied it held information, it would,\nin effect, confirm whether staff who left the council received\nsettlements.\nOn the face of it, the requested information does not directly identify\nany individual(s).

However, there is\nalso a public interest in upholding standard practice in HR matters, which\nis to observe a duty of confidentiality. The council has therefore decided\nin this case that confirmation or denial is not necessary to meet the\nlegitimate interest in disclosure. As confirmation or denial is not\nnecessary, there is no lawful basis for this processing, and it is\nunlawful.\nFurther stating:\nYou might consider that there is also a public interest in matters\nsettling without taking up tribunal time. That is encouraged by the courts\nand these types of agreement are a common way of meeting that public\ninterest. If both we and the other parties thought that an FOI would\nresult in the Council not abiding by the agreements, then less cases would\nsettle.\nResponse following Internal Review\nThe staff member who dealt with the original request carefully checked and\nconsidered the legal implications. They felt the council\u2019s common law duty\nof confidentiality should take precedence over other interests and failure\nto observe this could lead to an actionable breach of confidence.\nIn conducting this review, I have reconsidered, checked the legal\nposition, and formed the view that it would be unlawful to reveal, not\nonly the financial information pertaining to the agreements, but also\nconfirming the existence of them could lead to the identification of the\nstaff in question. This would be especially likely where there has been a\nhigh-profile departure. It could also lead to individuals being\nerroneously linked with financial settlements. In addition, I have\nconfirmed that the numbers of staff who may be offered such agreements is\nlow, and this would make identification more likely for the individuals in\nquestion.\nAdvice and Assistance\nUnder section 16, Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance. In our reply, we did not indicate that some\nof the information you requested is, or will be, in the public domain.\nInformation about exit payments is supplied to central government and\npublished here: [1]Local authority exit payments, England, 2014-15 to\n2020-21 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) and [2]Live tables on local government\nfinance - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) for the years 2021-22 and 2022-23.\nOur audited accounts for 2023-24 are not yet available so has not been\nsupplied at this time. We shall make a return to central government in due\ncourse, and it is possible that relevant information may be published at\nthe above link.\nPoints to Note\nThe government information shown gives the number of ex-gratia payments\nmade and the total amount although not the highest payments made. You will\nnote that some information has been redacted \u2018to protect confidentiality\u2019,\ndenoted by [c]. You will see that other public authorities also show\nredacted information, which aims to ensure that individuals are not\nidentified.\nThe government \u2018metadata\u2019 tab explains the information more fully, but\nincludes the following:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where fewer than five exit payment packages were awarded, all other\ndata for the category has been suppressed.\n\u2022\u00a0Where fewer than five exit payment packages including ex gratia and /\nor other payments were awarded, only the total value of all exit\npackages, the number of all exit packages and the mean cost of all\nexit packages are shown.\n\u2022\u00a0Additional suppression of data has been applied where only one local\nauthority / class of authority would otherwise be suppressed to ensure\nthe suppressed figure cannot be deduced from the Total.\nThis government collated data is not the exact information you have\nrequested and shows aggregated figures for all termination payments\nregardless of whether a \u2018non-disclosure\u2019 or confidentiality clause exists\nwithin the agreement. However, it does give the total value of payments,\nwhich is what you have requested.\nConclusion\nWe consider that we were correct to apply section 40(5B)(a)(i) of FOIA to\ninformation relating to your request for the numbers of staff and maximum\nsingle payments in each of the years 2021-24.\nWe should have considered our duties under s16 and offered the advice and\nassistance, directing you to where the total cost of payments, including\nsettlements that may be relevant to your inquiry have been published. This\nhas now been rectified and advice and assistance given above.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the outcome of this review, you can make a\ncomplaint to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office:\n[3][\nemail address\n]\nYours sincerely,\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [4][Sheffield City Council request email]\nThis Email, and any attachments, may contain non-public information and is\nintended solely for the individual(s) to whom it is addressed.
