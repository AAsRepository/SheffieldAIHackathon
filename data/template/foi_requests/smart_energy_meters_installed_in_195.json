Most\ncommercial entities wouldn\u2019t be watching live data to make reductions,\nlike you could in a domestic setting, as they either require lighting,\nheating and so on to operate or they don\u2019t, it tends to be much more\nbinary than domestic usage. We do however have AMR metering across the\nmajority of our portfolio of gas and electricity supplies.\n- Please provide the data split by property type\nN/A, we don\u2019t have any smart meters installed.\n- If available, please provide the date/year the smart energy meters were\ninstalled\nN/A, we don\u2019t have any smart meters installed.\n- If available, please provide any available data on when smart energy\nmeters are planned to be installed on the premises which don't already\nhave them.\nThere are no plans to install smart meters as we utilise AMR meters.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
