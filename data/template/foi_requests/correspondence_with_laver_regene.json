Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our\nrecords. We searched the following domains: @laver.co.uk; @lavergroup.com;\n@bolsterstone.com from 01/01/2015. We identified 4,821 (3.14GB) records\nand we estimate that it would take 2 minutes to search each record.\nTherefore, it would take us 160 hours to collate the information, which is\nmore than the cost limit of 18 hours or \u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom\nof Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees)\nRegulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters.
