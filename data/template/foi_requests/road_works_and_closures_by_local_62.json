The total number of road works carried out within your council\nlocality. This refers only to road works undertaken by the authority or\nits contractors on behalf of the council. It does not include street works\nundertaken by utility companies, their contractors, or private developers.\n8040 permits were approved for Amey works between 1^st January 2024 to\n31^st December 2024.\nPlease note that in some instances, works may not have taken place.\nWe are withholding this information under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the\nEnvironmental Information Regulations 2004 on the grounds that it would be\nmanifestly unreasonable to comply with the request. We do not record this\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis and therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of each\nrecord. It is estimated that checking would take approximately two (2)\nminutes per permit which would total approximately 268 hours.\nRegulation 12(4)(b) is subject to a public interest test. Factors in\nfavour of disclosure are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it\nis not in the public interest to spend such a large amount of officer time\non providing this information, as this would come at a large cost to the\ncouncil and would divert officers from being able to carry out other work.\nOn balance, the council believes that the public interest lies in\nmaintaining the exception.\n2. The total number of road closures due to road works within your council\nlocality. This includes full road closures, partial road closures, and\nnighttime closures.\n1508 permits were approved which required some form of highway closure.\nThese included footway and carriageway works.\nPlease note that in some instances, works may not have taken place.\u00a0 This\ninformation is not in a readily searchable format.\u00a0 To calculate the\nactual number of road works, each permit would have to be checked\nmanually.\u00a0 It is estimated that checking would take approximately two (2)\nminutes per permit which would total approximately 50 hours.\u00a0 We consider\nthis to be manifestly unreasonable.\n3. The duration of each road work project carried out within your council\nlocality.\nIf available, please provide:\nStart date\nEnd date (or indicate if still ongoing)\nIf the project lasted less than a day, please provide the duration in\nhours where possible.\nSee attached data titled \u2018FOI 1805584 \u2013 Data\u2019 under tab Q3. Total Permits.\nInformation regarding exact working time on site is not in a readily\nsearchable format.\u00a0 To calculate the actual period, each permit and\nassociated jobs would have to be checked manually.\u00a0 It is estimated that\nchecking would take approximately five (5) minutes per permit which would\ntotal approximately 670 hours.\u00a0 We consider this to be manifestly\nunreasonable as with the exception quoted in the answer to Q1.\nWhere the permit start and end dates are the same, that is, all the works\nare completed within the same day, we have assumed 5 hours as an average\ntimescale for the duration of the works.\n4.
