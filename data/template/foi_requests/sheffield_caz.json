The modelling conducted for\nthe scheme targets roads and as such the train station / power plant\nelement is captured by an assumed background concentration applied to add\nin \u201call other sources\u201d other than the roads mapped rather than being\nindividually mapped. The background concentrations for the Clean Air Plan\nwere taken from the DEFRA Background maps.\n2. How does Sheffield City Council distinguish all the emissions from\nSheffield Station and all its anciliary operations from those of road\ntraffic emissions.\nSheffield CC monitor ambient concentrations, which is a collective of all\nemission source and is not quantifiable to individual polluters using the\nmonitors. As such the only way to estimate emission contribution is\nthrough modelling, which has been done throughout, both by Sheffield CC\nand National Government to determine the primary cause of NO[2].\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
