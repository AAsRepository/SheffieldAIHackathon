                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nOn 22 December 2019 I submitted FOI.\nBetween 22 December 2019 and March 2020 there appears to have been communication with Amey regarding my request about the regarding the contents of the email box associated with the former Director of Culture and Environment 1438. It appears from documents released so far there were discussions between Amey and SCC to discuss the statutory duty of information sharing and a \"planned approach\".\nIt seems there was no public consultation or information shared publicly on the council website regarding \"SCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\". This request hopes to find more information on this \"planned approach to information sharing\", I wasn't aware of it before hand. Or that there was a consultation on it.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve previously stated back in March we explained our concerns and reasoning behind rejecting the councils intent to share further information.\u201d - RE: FOI REQUESTS - 1369 and 1438, 22 July 2020 11:11\n\u201cdirectly discuss the nature of our concerns and despite this have not heard back from the Council since writing to you early in March.\u2028\"\n1. Other than Amey, please identify  how many external parties SCC has consulted with regards to \"SCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\".\n2. Please identify and provide any recorded information between 22 December 2019 - July 22 2020, where any part of the document is in relation to the following statement: \u201cconcerns and reasoning behind rejecting the councils intent to share further information\u201d in association to request 1438 or any other future FOI request.\n\u201cIll wait to hear back re a meeting/call but do feel much of our we\u2019d hope can be addressed thro\u2019 gaining a better insight into SCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\u201d - 22 July 2020\n3. Please provide any correspondence, memoranda, documents, reports, records, statements, notes, examinations, opinions, folders, files, manuals, pamphlets, forms, drawings, charts, photographs, electronic mail, and other documents and things that refer of relate to the following \u201cSCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\u201d as discussed with Amey in relation to FOI 1369 & 1438 and FOI requests in the future. I believe there was a meeting between Amey and SCC the requested documents should be in relation to that meeting.\n4. Please identify and provide the earliest correspondence SCC sent to Amey in relation to my request 1438, please provide any replies and subsequent discussions around 1438 between these two parties.\n5. Please identify the date the FOI time had received the information from record custodians for 1438.\n6.

The square brackets are ours.\n[Background supplied by you]\nOn 22 December 2019 I submitted FOI [2019-20-1438]\nBetween 22 December 2019 and March 2020 there appears to have been\ncommunication with Amey regarding my request about the regarding the\ncontents of the email box associated with the former Director of Culture\nand Environment 1438. It appears from documents released so far there were\ndiscussions between Amey and SCC to discuss the statutory duty of\ninformation sharing and a \"planned approach\".\nIt seems there was no public consultation or information shared publicly\non the council website regarding \"SCC\u2019s planned approach to information\nsharing\". This request hopes to find more information on this \"planned\napproach to information sharing\", I wasn't aware of it before hand. Or\nthat there was a consultation on it.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve previously stated back in March we explained our concerns and\nreasoning behind rejecting the councils intent to share further\ninformation.\u201d - RE: FOI REQUESTS - 1369 and 1438, 22 July 2020 11:11\n\u201cdirectly discuss the nature of our concerns and despite this have not\nheard back from the Council since writing to you early in March.\u2028\"\n1. Other than Amey, please identify how many external parties SCC has\nconsulted with regards to \"SCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\".\nNone.\n2. Please identify and provide any recorded information between 22\nDecember 2019 - July 22 2020, where any part of the document is in\nrelation to the following statement: \u201cconcerns and reasoning behind\nrejecting the councils intent to share further information\u201d in association\nto request 1438 or any other future FOI request.\nWe do not hold any information other than that which we have already\nprovided in our response to FOI 2020-21-2390 submitted by Mr Buxton:\n[1]\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/o...\nSome of the information we released in our response to FOI 2020-21-2390\nwas subject to redaction for the following reasons, and we maintain that\nthose reasons apply to this request. For reference, the exemptions we\napplied were:\nSection 40(2) exempts information in response to a request if it is\npersonal data belonging to an individual other than yourself and it\nsatisfies one of the conditions listed in the legislation. (1) The\ncondition contained in section 40(3A)(a) applies, that disclosure would\nbreach one of the data protection principles. The principle is that\n\u201cPersonal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent\nmanner...\u201d (2) We do not consider that disclosing this information to you,\nand consequently the public, is necessary or justified to satisfy your\ninformation request and the requirements of the FOIA. In the circumstances\nof this request there is no strong legitimate interest that would override\nthe prejudice to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. We have\ntherefore taken the decision that disclosing this information to you would\nbe unlawful.\n(1) Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 contained in the\nData Protection Act 2018.\n(2) GDPR EU2016, Article 5(1)(a).\nPlease note that some information was redacted under section 42 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 2000 on the grounds that this information is\nsubject to legal professional privilege. Section 42 is a qualified\nexemption which is subject to a public interest test. Factors in favour of\ndisclosing the information are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it\nis important to protect the concept of legal professional privilege and\nthe rationale behind the concept, which is to safeguard frankness between\nlawyer and client, and this serves the wider administration of justice. On\nbalance, the Council believes that the public interest lies in maintaining\nthe exception.\n\u201cIll wait to hear back re a meeting/call but do feel much of our we\u2019d hope\ncan be addressed thro\u2019 gaining a better insight into SCC\u2019s planned\napproach to information sharing\u201d - 22 July 2020\n3. Please provide any correspondence, memoranda, documents, reports,\nrecords, statements, notes, examinations, opinions, folders, files,\nmanuals, pamphlets, forms, drawings, charts, photographs, electronic mail,\nand other documents and things that refer of relate to the following\n\u201cSCC\u2019s planned approach to information sharing\u201d as discussed with Amey in\nrelation to FOI 1369 & 1438 and FOI requests in the future. I believe\nthere was a meeting between Amey and SCC the requested documents should be\nin relation to that meeting.\nPlease see 20200917_Principles for good communications between Amey PLC &\nSheffield City Council (SCC) regarding tree related FOIA_EIR requests\n(attached).\nPlease note the redaction is subject to the exemption for personal data\nset out in Q2 above.\n4. Please identify and provide the earliest correspondence SCC sent to\nAmey in relation to my request 1438, please provide any replies and\nsubsequent discussions around 1438 between these two parties.\nEmails from March 2020\nSee attached: RE_ Freedom of Information requests 1369 & 1438 - WITHOUT\nPREJUDICE AND SUBJECT TO COMMON INTEREST PRIVILEGE - NOT SUBJECT TO FOIA\nEmails from after the disclosure (4 September 2020)\nSee attached: RE_ Confidential - Commercially Sensitive - Subject to\nCommon Interest Privilege - Without prejudice\n(Not included in the email thread is the attachment provided in (3) above\nwhich is otherwise part of it).\nPlease note the redactions of senders and recipients and other personal\ninformation is subject to the exemption for personal data set out in Q2\nabove.\nWe have withheld information from an email of 15 September 2020 6:05 PM.\nThis information is exempt from disclosure under section 42(1) of the\nFreedom of Information Act 2000 because it is subject to legal\nprofessional privilege (LPP). LPP protects the confidentiality of legally\nrelated communications. In this case, communications between Amey and the\nCouncil are caught by the exemption.\nThis exemption is subject to a public interest test. Factors in favour of\ndisclosing the information are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it\nis important to protect the concept of legal professional privilege and\nthe rationale behind the concept, which is to safeguard frankness between\nlawyer and client. On balance, the Council believes that the public\ninterest lies in maintaining the exemption.\nWe included everything else (subject to redactions) in the response to\n2020-21-2390. See response to Q2.\n5. Please identify the date the FOI time had received the information from\nrecord custodians for 1438.\nWe obtained access to the relevant emails on 6 January 2020.\n6. Please identify and provide records from that could show the requestor\nthe delay from the time indicated in (5.) to the completed decision notice\nin relation to 1438.\nFrom 6 January to 6 March, we were working on reviewing what information\nfell within scope of the request and making any necessary redactions.\nFrom 6 March to 17 March, we were trying to organise a meeting with Amey\nto consult them on the disclosure.\nIn the week commencing 17 March, the first lockdown began. During this\ntime, the Council had to consider the redeployment of staff to keep\ncritical services running. For some time, the Information Management Team\nwere diverted to work to provide a large number of staff with IT equipment\nto enable them to work properly from home, which had an impact on the\nprocessing of FOI and SAR requests. In addition, staff changes placed\nadditional workload on members of the Information Management Team over the\nsummer. These delays meant the meeting with Amey took place on 29 July.\nFollowing the meeting, we needed to review the documents we had prepared\nfor disclosure, which took a further four-five weeks due to staff being\nleave, and because of having to complete other work. A response was issued\non 4 September 2020.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
