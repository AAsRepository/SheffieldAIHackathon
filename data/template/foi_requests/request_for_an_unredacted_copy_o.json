A court of law was wronged by SCC on at least two occasions: in 2016 and in 2017. At paragraph 5.2, the minutes of the meeting record that Cllr Hunt responded as follows:\n\u201cI have been assured that the apology will be sent to the court before the end of this month. This will be made public and I have asked officers to notify you when this takes place.\u201d\nSOURCE (Item 5):\nhttps://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/docum...\nhttps://ianswalkonthewildside.wordpress....\nTo date (1st January 2024), the SCC apology to the law courts has not been shared with the public or made publicly accessible.\nPlease provide a complete, unredacted copy of the SCC apology to the law courts. Please state:\n1)\tthe authors of the apology;\n2)\tthe date the apology was sent, in each case;\n3)\tthe name and title of the addressee/s;\n4)\tthe position held by the addressee/s.\nTo understand the basis for this request, and the strong level of public interest in the apology, see the comments associated with this request, below.\nYours faithfully,\nMr David Long"

The information was\nalready held with a view to such publication at the time when the request\nfor information was made and we consider that it is reasonable in all the\ncircumstances that the information should be withheld from disclosure to\nensure that it can be received by the judicial authorities first before it\nis disclosed to the public.\nSection 22 is a qualified exemption which is subject to the public\ninterest test. Factors in favour of disclosure are that disclosure\npromotes openness and transparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the\nexemption are that there is a public interest in ensuring that there is\ntime for the judicial system to consider the submission before it is made\npublic, and that the timetable properly requires due time for those\nauthorities prior to its public release. On balance, the Council believes\nthat the public interest lies in maintaining the exemption.\nPlease state:\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the authors of the apology; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 David\nHollis, General Counsel and Kate Josephs, Chief Executive\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the date the apology was sent, in each case; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 22 December 2023\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the name and title of the addressee/s; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right\nHonourable Alex Chalke KC MP\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the position held by the addressee/s. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lord\nChancellor and Secretary of State for Justice\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.

One month has been sufficient time for for the communication to be received by the judicial system and authorities to consider the submission and for the Lord Chancellor\u2019s office to respond.\nWe - SORT & I - KNOW that, on balance, it is NOT in the public interest for Sheffield City Council to maintain the exemption that it currently uses to obfuscate and deny access to the requested communication - a communication that should have been issued in the summer of 2023 (rather than at Christmas). See item 2, here:\nhttps://ianswalkonthewildside.wordpress....\nA full history of my FOI request and all correspondence is available on the Internet at this address:\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/r...\nDid the communication that I have requested include a request that the addressee respond to the communication?
