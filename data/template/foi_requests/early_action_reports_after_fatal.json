                "1 Attachment\nTOP KSI SITES 2024 2023 data FINAL PDF 003.pdf\n289K\nDownload\nView as HTML\nDear Graham Wroe,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Early Action\nReports after fatal collisions and locations of KSI's which we received on\n08/10/2024.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request below:\nPlease could you provide the Early Action reports made after fatal\ncollisions on Sheffield roads in the last 5 years.\nThe Early Action reports contain confidential information, including\ndetails of the fatal collision received from South Yorkshire Police, which\nmight have relevance for future Coroner\u2019s Inquests or Police\nProsecutions.\u00a0 Releasing such information into the public domain could\nprejudice these proceedings or lead to individuals being identified.\nThe information is exempt from disclosure under Regulation 12(3) of the\nEnvironmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) and\u00a0Regulation 13 EIR as\namended by Sch. 19, para 307 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which\nprovide an exception for where the\u00a0information requested includes personal\ndata where disclosure would contravene the data protection principles of\nthe\u00a0UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Disclosure of the\ninformation would contravene the data protection principle under Article\n5(1)(a) that processing of personal data must be lawful, fair, and\ntransparent.\nThe rest of the information has been withheld under Regulation 12(5)(b) of\nthe EIR, which provides an exception from the disclosure of environmental\ninformation which would adversely affect the course of justice. The course\nof justice covers the the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or\nthe ability of a public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or\ndisciplinary nature. This exception is subject to a public interest test.\nFactors in favour of disclosing the information are that disclosure\npromotes openness and transparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the\nexception are that it is important not to undermine the court process and\nthe jurisdiction of the court, which has the power to determine what may\nbe disclosed, and this serves the wider administration of justice. On\nbalance, the Council believes that the public interest lies in maintaining\nthe exception.\nCould you also provide the list of 59 locations identified as having at\nleast 3 KSIs (Killed or seriously injured) in the Road Safety Action Plan?\nPlease provide the conclusions of investigations into the 17 or more of\nthese that have been investigated so far.\nPlease find attached the latest list of the locations that have been\nidentified for inclusion in the Local Safety Scheme programme. The\nconclusions of the investigations carried out so far are included. This is\nan ongoing project and is not yet completed, therefore not all locations\nhave conclusions recorded. Please note that based on the latest collision\ndata there are 53 locations on this list in total, not 59.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [1]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an\ninternal review by replying to this email.
