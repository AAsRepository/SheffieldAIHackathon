                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nPlease provide the names of all those on the Sheffield Stronger Together Leadership Group (first meeting 5th November and as reported at Strategy & Resources 20th November).  As this is apparently a \u2018partnership group\u2019 not \u2018led\u2019 by the council (although apparently chaired by the Leader) I recognise that the council may try to say it does not \u2018own\u2019 this data.  In this case, however, I simply request the names of all those attending this meeting which was attended by council members on behalf of residents and voters.\n(Once again) I find it astounding that our public representatives (presumably supported by officers), in participating in a major initiative about \u2018leading\u2019 the city - for and on behalf of residents/voters has not seen fit to be wholly transparent about its running of the city and in anticipation of public interest.  This work comes out of the \u2018city goals\u2019 work which our council is claiming is somehow \u2018owned\u2019 by all in the city!  Yet the elite group now apparently leading this work is, at the outset, hidden!\nI would also like to know:\n- the specific governance arrangements in place for the partnership of \u2018leaders\u2019\n- where the minutes of the meetings will be publicly available, how the public can observe and participate directly (at all) in its work, and any other arrangements in place to enhance transparency and external accountability to citizens and communities.\nFinally, the council has reported that the \u2018transition team\u2019 has put the \u2018city leader\u2019 group arrangements in place and I request information about how city leaders were selected (criteria etc), minutes of \u2018transition team\u2019 meetings since the publication of the city goals and, again, which I am assuming council members and/or officers were part of.\nThe \u2018murkiness\u2019 of transparency and accountability arrangements for partnership groups involving combinations of statutory, corporate/private, and third sector partners is a live issue across the country (and has been for many years now)  and so I imagine this has been a priority in discussions setting up the partnership, (and given SCC\u2019s presentation of itself as a learning council).  It is nonetheless quite disturbing to be having to submit FOIs for basic information to meet very minimal democratic thresholds.\nThank you very much\nYours faithfully,\nRuth Hubbard"
