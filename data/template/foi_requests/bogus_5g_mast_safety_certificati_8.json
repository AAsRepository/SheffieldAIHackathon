                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI noticed that there is at least one potentially fraudulent ICNIRP safety certificate contained in Newcastle Upon Tyne City Council's planning portal, an online facility which displays details of planning applications and approvals.\nA company named \"Three UK Limited\" - which was dissolved in the year 2015 - has somehow become the signatory for at least one bogus safety certificate (sometimes referred to as a conformity statement) for a 5G telecommunications mast installation.\nUsing your best and most honest endeavours, please provide:\n1. A figure for the precise number of ICNIRP safety certificates related to 5G telecommunications mast installations that have been signed off by \"Three UK Limited\", a company that didn't exist at the time the relevant planning applications were made, and whose declared ICNIRP safety certificates are potentially fraudulent\n2. Actual copies of the ICNIRP safety certificates related to 5G telecommunications mast installations that have been signed off by \"Three UK Limited\", a company that didn't exist at the time of the planning applications, and are therefore potentially fraudulent\n3. The actual dates of the initial planning applications made for 5G telecommunications mast installations that have been allegedly ICNIRP 'safety certified' by bogus certificates, along with the named street locations and identifying nomenclature.\n4. The time period stated in years, months, weeks and days, between the date of the dissolution of \"Three UK Limited\" (27th October 2015) and the date of the initial applications made for all of the 5G telecommunications masts concerned, having bogus safety certificates, e.g. \"8 years, 2 months, 3 weeks and 5 days\"\n5. Given that the World Health Organisation classifies radio frequency - such as that transmitted 24/7 by 5G telecommunications masts - as a potential Type 2B carcinogen, that the power output of the affected 5G masts is unknown, that potentially a large number of safety certificates are potentially fraudulent, and that tens of thousands of Sheffield City Council Council residents have potentially been plunged into an unsafe environment, please provide detailed information explaining how Sheffield City Council Council is planning to restore council tax payers, voters, their children, and Sheffield City Council's wildlife and domestic pets back to a safe, non-hazardous environment, one which will no longer be a serious, ongoing, potential threat to residents' health and wellbeing?\nYours faithfully,\nPaul Cardin"

We\nsincerely apologise for not meeting our legal deadline of 17/09/2024.\nThank you for your chasers of 13/11/24 and 3/02/25.\nWe have breached the Code of Practice under Regulation 16 of the\nEnvironmental Information Regulations 2004, which states that we must\nrespond to your request for internal review within 40 working days.\nWe are not changing our response of 17 July 2024, and therefore not\nupholding your complaint. But we are setting out the search we undertook\nto meet your request, and investigating the status of an accompanying\nsafety certificate.\nWe do not specifically record 5G as a category just that a\nTelecommunications Notification has been received. If you follow the link\nbelow to the advanced search on our Planning Portal, then set the\napplication type to Telephone Notifications and insert the validation date\nfrom 01/01/2015 this will bring up more than 171 applications where you\ncan review the documents submitted.\n[1]Applications Search (sheffield.gov.uk)\nSearch Criteria\nWe have investigated whether a safety certificate should be submitted as\npart of the application.\nIn Class A, Part 16, Schedule 2 of the General Permitted Development Order\n2015 (as amended) states only that, as part of the prior approval process,\nan application for telecommunications installations must be accompanied\nby:\n(a) a written description of the proposed development and a plan\nindicating its proposed location together with any fee required to be\npaid;\n(b) the developer\u2019s contact address, and the developer\u2019s email address if\nthe developer is content to receive communications electronically;\n(c) evidence that the requirements of sub-paragraph (1) have been\nsatisfied where applicable; (NB This relates to giving notice to\nlandowners/tenants \u2013 Sheffield City Council) and\n(d) where sub-paragraph (3) the condition in paragraph A.2(5A) applies,\nevidence that the Civil Aviation Authority, the Secretary of State for\nDefence or the aerodrome operator operator of the civil safeguarding area\nor defence safeguarding area, as the case may be, has been notified of the\nproposal (NB This relates to proposals on a civil safeguarding area or a\ndefence safeguarding area \u2013 Sheffield City Council.)\nThere is no mention of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing\nRadiation Protection (ICNIRP).\nHowever, paragraph 121 of the National Planning Policy Framework states\nthat:\nApplications for electronic communications development (including\napplications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development\nOrder) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the\nproposed development. This should include:\na) the outcome of consultations with organisations with an interest in the\nproposed development, in particular with the relevant body where a mast is\nto be installed near a school or college, or within a statutory\nsafeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome, technical site or military\nexplosives storage area; and\nb) for an addition to an existing mast or base station, a statement that\nself-certifies that the cumulative exposure, when operational, will not\nexceed International Commission guidelines on non-ionising radiation\nprotection; or\nc) for a new mast or base station, evidence that the applicant has\nexplored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building,\nmast or other structure and a statement that self-certifies that, when\noperational, International Commission guidelines will be met. (Our\nemphasis)\nApplicants should therefore be submitting a certificate demonstrating\ncompliance with the ICNIRP\u00a0guidelines.\nOur response applies only to the information we hold.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
