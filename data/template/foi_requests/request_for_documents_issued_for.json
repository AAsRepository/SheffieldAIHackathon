This was accompanied by a one page 'Undertaking To Sheffield City Council' sheet for signing before 11th July 2017. I have copies of both these documents.\nOn 26 July 2017, a number of defendants at Leeds High Court for the case (D92LS739) of the above mentioned injunction application (SCC vs Alice Fairhall et al) signed undertakings shortly before the first hearing began. I would like to know what documents they were issued. I presume they would have been given pre-protocol letters along with the undertaking sheet to sign. I request these as I want to see if they differ from those issued on 27 June 2017.\nYours faithfully,\nMartin Pickles"

                "Dear FOI,\nThank you for your partial response to my FOI request. Unfortunately, you have referred me to supposedly 'relevant' files from the Street Tree Archive which are all restricted so they can\u2019t be accessed and one is non-existent. This is clearly of no use to my enquiry and a waste of my time entering each case number.\nMy request is quite straightforward but I think I could have worded it better to focus your response. I would like to rephrase my question which I hope will get us to a satisfactory response more quickly:\nIn 2017, Sheffield City Council issued requests to a number of people to sign 'undertakings' regarding their protest behaviour against the unnecessary felling of street trees. Requests were issued at different times, eg.; by letters dated 27.06.17 and 29.06.17, both Ref. GEG/079474. Undertakings were signed at different times; some before the first deadline of 11.07.17, some before an extended deadline of 20.07.17 granted by SCC via Howells Solicitors, one or more signed just before the first hearing of case D92LS739 at Leeds High Court on 26.07.17. There are possibly other dates in 2017 when undertaking requests were issued and signed. I would like to know if and how the text of the request documentation and undertaking forms to be signed were different. In short, did the conditions for \u2018undertakers\u2019 vary?\nYours sincerely,\nMartin Pickles"
