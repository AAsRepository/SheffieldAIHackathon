                "Dear Richard Roberts,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Completion notices\nwhich we received on 12/12/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nWe publish some business rates information on our Open Data website at the\nfollowing link: [1]\nhttps://datamillnorth.org/dataset/scc-bu...\n.\nPlease note that the data we publish is limited and does not include all\nof the information you requested.\nIn case EA/2018/0055; Sheffield City Council vs Information Commissioner\nand Gavin Chait, the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber)\nInformation Rights upheld the Council\u2019s appeal against the Information\nCommissioner\u2019s decision (decision notice FS50681336\n[2]\nhttps://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-tak...\n)\nthat the Council should publish this information. Consequently, the\nCouncil maintains that this information is exempt from disclosure for the\nfollowing reasons.\nSection 40 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000\nSome of the information requested relates to sole traders and/or\npartnerships. This information is exempt from disclosure under section\n40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that it is personal\ndata and disclosure would contravene the data protection principle under\nArticle 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation that processing\nof personal data must be fair, lawful and transparent.\nIt would not be fair, lawful or transparent for the Council to disclose\nthis data as individuals have a legitimate expectation that personal\ninformation held by the Council for the purpose of calculating business\nrates is used only for those purposes and will not be published.\nPublication would increase the risk of crime in relation to that\nindividual\u2019s property if it was empty, and would increase the risk of\nbusiness rates fraud against that individual. Knowledge of this increased\nrisk would lead to distress for the individuals and this would cause\nprejudice to the rights and freedoms of the individuals.\nSection 41 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000\nThe information you have requested is exempt from disclosure under section\n41(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Under section 41(1)(a),\ninformation is exempt from disclosure if its disclosure would constitute\nan actionable breach of confidence. To demonstrate an actionable breach of\nconfidence, the information must have the necessary quality of confidence,\nmust have been shared in circumstances which give rise to an obligation of\nconfidence and its disclosure would have to lead to an actionable breach\nof confidence.\nIn this instance, information provided to a local authority for the\npurposes of calculating rates or reliefs is information that a reasonable\nperson would regard as confidential. It is not already in the public\ndomain and therefore it has the necessary quality of confidence.\nThe information was shared with the Council in circumstances which give\nrise to an obligation of confidence as individuals would not expect that\ninformation held by the Council for the purposes of calculating rates or\nreliefs would be used for other purposes or be published.\nDisclosure of the information would lead to an actionable breach of\nconfidence as, if the Council were to disclose the information, it would\nbreach the general common law principle of taxpayer confidentiality.\nConsequently, the information requested is exempt from disclosure under\nsection 41 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [3]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an\ninternal review by replying to this email. Internal review requests should\nbe submitted within 40 working days from the date of this response.\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you\ncan contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.
