                "Dear Guy Mayhew,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Street Lighting\nClassification for Footways & Cycleways which we received on 11/02/2025.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1) The lighting classes (e.g. P1, P2, P3, C4, etc.) used for footways\nwithin your administrative area, specifying if these differ for:\n- Primary footways (high-footfall areas such as city centres, high\nstreets, or transport hubs).\nFootpaths in these areas were either included in the C class calculation\nappropriate for the area (city centre / high streets etc) or were covered\nby the surround ratio aspect of the chosen M class (traffic routes M2, M3\nor M4) in our 2012 \u2013 2017 CIP design to BS5489.\n- Secondary footways (medium footfall, e.g. residential and suburban\nstreets).\nThese were included in the relevant P class designated to the street (P3,\nP4 or P5 depending on road class). The calculations included from rear of\nfootpath to rear of footpath in our 2012 \u2013 2017 CIP design to BS5489.\n- Tertiary footways (low footfall areas such as cul-de-sacs, alleyways, or\nrural paths).\nCul de-sacs were included in the relevant P class designated to the street\n(P4 or P5 depending on road class). The calculations included from rear of\nfootpath to rear of footpath. Alleyways and rural paths were lit to P5/P6\nbut only if they previously had a system of road lighting. Previously\nunlit footpaths remained unlit in our 2012 \u2013 2017 CIP design to BS5489.\n2) The lighting class used for cycleways, particularly where they are:\n- Dedicated cycleways (physically separated from roads and footways).\nDedicated routes were treated the same as alleyways / rural footpaths in\nour 2012 \u2013 2017 CIP design to BS5489\n- Shared footway/cycleway routes.\nIf adjacent to a road, then these were covered by the surround ratio\naspect of the chosen M class (traffic routes M2, M3 or M4. Dedicated\nroutes were treated the same as alleyways / rural footpaths in our 2012 \u2013\n2017 CIP design to BS5489\n3) If different lighting classes are applied depending on location (urban\nvs rural), please provide a breakdown:\nAll remote footpaths being treated the same, wherever the location.\nFootways adjacent to carriageways were included in the chosen class for\nthe road which would differ between rural and urban in our 2012 \u2013 2017 CIP\ndesign to BS5489\n4) Any internal policies, guidance, or strategy documents that define or\ninform how lighting classes are selected for footways and cycleways:\nThis is determined by the lighting class assigned by Sheffield City\nCouncil to the relevant street.
