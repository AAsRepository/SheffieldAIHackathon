                "Dear Nicola Gilbert,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Cost of Draft Local\nPlan Consultant for Sheffield City Council which we received on\n01/02/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request below:\n1.\u00a0The total cost of the Whole Plan Viability Appraisal (WPVA) was\n\u00a329,500.\n2.\u00a0The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), paragraph 34 says that:\n\u2018Plans should set out the contributions expected from development. This\nshould include setting out the levels and types of affordable housing\nprovision required, along with other infrastructure (such as that needed\nfor education, health, transport, flood and water management, green and\ndigital infrastructure). Such policies should not undermine the\ndeliverability of the plan.\u2019\nIt is usual practice for local planning authorities to carry out an\nassessment of the cumulative impact of the policies in the local plan on\ndevelopment viability.\u00a0 If development cannot be shown to be economically\nviable, then it is unlikely it will be deliverable.\u00a0 The WPVA will used as\nevidence at the public examination to demonstrate that the plan is viable\nand would, therefore, be \u2018effective\u2019. The effectiveness of the plan is one\nof the four tests of soundness set out in paragraph 35 of the NPPF.\nUltimately, the decision to set 10% Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) was a\njudgment made by Members on the advice of officers, taking into account\nthe findings in the WPVA. A number of different policy objectives had to\nbe balanced \u2013 for example, the need to provide affordable housing, the\nneed to provide wheelchair adaptable housing and the need to cut carbon\ndioxide emissions.\u00a0 Although the Draft Plan requires developers to provide\n10% net gain, Policy GS6 does make clear that higher levels of BNG will be\nrequired where:\n\u2022\u00a0there is a particular ecological need in that location based on\nevidence in a biodiversity/nature recovery action plan or as part of\nthe Local Nature Recovery Network mapping, or\n\u2022\u00a0there is evidence of rare/protected species within, or close to, the\ndevelopment site; or\n\u2022\u00a0the site starts with very low or nil existing biodiversity value\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
