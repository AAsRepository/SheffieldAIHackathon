This also includes the road leading to the bus\ngate from (and including) the Arundel Gate/Furnival Square roundabout.\nMost recently you contacted us on 18 October 2023 to find out about your\nresponse.\nWe apologise for the delay in processing your request which was an\nadministrative oversight. We partially uphold your complaint because we\nhave breached the Code of Practice under Regulation 16 of the\nEnvironmental Information Regulation 2004, which states that organisations\nshould respond to a complainant within 40 working days from the time when\nthe complaint was received. We sincerely apologise for the delay on this\noccasion, but we have had a significant backlog of requests that is taking\nus a long time to get through.\nWe processed this request under the EIR because information which bears\nupon the environment is exempt under section 39 of the Freedom of\nInformation Act 2000. Regulation 2(1)(a) provides a definition of\nenvironmental information. See: [1]Regulation 2(1) - What is environmental\ninformation? | ICO Our view was that your request met the criterion in (c)\nas it was for a \u201cplan\u201d(s). The public authority then needs to process it\nunder the EIR, which is similar, but contains different provisions to the\nFOI.\nWe are attaching the requested information.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
