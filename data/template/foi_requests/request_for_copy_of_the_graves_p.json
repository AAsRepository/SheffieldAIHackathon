                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nIn November 2020, the Friends of Graves Park were asked by a council officer (name can be supplied on request) to submit any ideas for improvements in Graves Park. The Friends spent some time and effort, sometimes during lockdown, to produce a 42 point plan of action, which we submitted in March 2021.\nWe were told that this plan would be included in the council\u2019s plan for the improvements for Graves Park and that our Overview would be included in its entirety in the appendices. We were also told that the council officer would send us a copy when it was complete.\nSince then, despite repeated requests, we have not received a copy of this \u201cGraves Park Strategic Options Plan\u201d, so we are now requesting one.\nCan you please send us a copy of the council\u2019s Graves Park Strategic Options Plan, including the appendices?\nIf it has since been renamed, we would like a copy of the document that started its life as the \u201cGraves Park Visions Plan\u201d.\nYours faithfully,\nCaroline Dewar"
