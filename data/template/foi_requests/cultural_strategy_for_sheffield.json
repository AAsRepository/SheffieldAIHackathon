                "Dear Rachel Gardiner,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Cultural Strategy\nfor Sheffield Consultant which we received on 09/11/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request below:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complete tender responses from suppliers who applied for this\ncontract and were both successful and not successful\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The scoring of each tender response\nThe Council considers that the information provided under a tender\nprocess, including the scoring of each tender response, is subject to a\nduty of confidence and is therefore exempt under Section 41 of the Freedom\nof Information Act 2000.\nSection 41 exempts information if it is given to the Council in\ncircumstances which create a duty of confidence, and that disclosure would\nbe an actionable breach of that duty of confidence. The information being\nrequested was received by the Council during a tender process, which is\nconsidered to be a submission in confidence. Disclosure of this\ninformation is likely to be considered a breach of confidence, possibly\nresulting in action being taken against the Council. The information\nsubmitted under the process carries a duty of confidence as a result.\nSection 43 provides information is exempt if its disclosure would, or\nwould likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (which\nincludes a company). The disclosure of this information may prejudice the\ncompany\u2019s commercial interests as it would reveal information about the\nprice, they are willing to accept for this project.\nSection 41 is an absolute exemption, but Section 43 is a qualified\nexemption and subject to a public interest test to consider whether it is\nin the public interest to maintain the exemption or to disclose the\ninformation.\nPublic interest arguments in favour of disclosing the information:\nThere is always interest in the way public authorities spend money. In the\ncurrent financial climate, there is greater need to ensure public money is\nbeing spent on the right services and activities whilst getting the best\nvalue.\nThe Council does, wherever lawful and possible, disclose information about\nthe money it spends, the decisions it makes and the activities it carries\nout because it helps to:\n\u2022\u00a0Improve public awareness and allow members of the public to engage in\npublic debate about decisions and initiatives affecting the locality.\n\u2022\u00a0Promote accountability and transparency in the way public money is\nspent and the process behind contracting services.\n\u2022\u00a0Encourage other potential suppliers to bid for contracts, leading to\ngreater competition, and possibly decreasing the cost to the Council.\nPublic interest arguments in favour of maintaining the exemption:\nThe tender process is a critical process in determining what services can\nbe acquired. It is a process that requires interested parties to bid for\nwork and to be clear about what services can be offered and delivered with\nagreed timescales and at what cost.\nThe Council understands the need for transparency and openness, but also\nneeds to weigh up the impact of disclosing information about other\norganisations, which in this case might:\n\u2022\u00a0Result in legal action if the organisation wishes to pursue a breach\nof confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality is well established in\nlaw and there is a strong interest in confidence being maintained.\n\u2022\u00a0Impact on the organisation\u2019s ability to compete in a competitive\nmarket because information about a bidding failure may hit commercial\nor public confidence in the firm. This may result in the loss of\nbusiness the company receives together with its ability to obtain\nsupplies or secure finance, and in more extreme cases, jobs.\n\u2022\u00a0Discourage companies to bid for future work with the Council amid\nconcerns that information will be disclosed despite their wishes,\nwhich may result in fewer choices and higher costs for the Council.\n\u2022\u00a0Prejudice the commercial interests of the Council by affecting\nadversely its bargaining position during contractual negotiations\nwhich would result in the less effective use of public money.\n\u2022\u00a0Reduce tender submissions if businesses disengage from the bidding\nprocess if they consider they are unable to compete with the disclosed\nbidders in any other future process.\nBalance of the public interest arguments\nOn consideration of the points above, we believe the public interest in\nmaintaining the exemption outweighs the interest in disclosing the\ninformation and therefore have decided that the information should be\nrefused.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The value of the winning tender\nThe successful consultants are Fourth Street Place Consultants Ltd, with\nthe fee being \u00a370k.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who is the senior officer (outside of procurement) responsible for\nthis contract?\nDiana Buckley, Director of Economy, Skills, and Culture\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
