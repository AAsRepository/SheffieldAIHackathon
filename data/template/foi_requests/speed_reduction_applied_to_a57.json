However, a review can sometimes be delayed and I apologise\nfor this.\nI can now confirm that a full and impartial review of the handling of your\nrequest has been conducted, with a summary as follows:\nYou contacted the council on January 25 2023, to request specific details\nrelating to the speed reduction applied to the A57 and I note that you are\nyet to receive a response.\nYour email received by the Council on 24 March 2023 explained that you\nwere requesting an internal review of the handling of your request.\nI have reviewed the context of your request and have determined that\nfirstly, the Council is in breach of the Code of Practice under section 45\nof the FOI Act, which requires a response to an internal review within a\nmonth; and we have taken two months to reply.
