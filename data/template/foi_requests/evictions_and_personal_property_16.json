Over the past twelve months, how many people have been evicted from\nlocal authority property? Total evictions for 2018/19 = 219\n2. Over the past twelve months, how many evicted people have been\nlicensees?\nIf someone had an SCC property on licence, the Council would not evict\nthem. The provider may evict them, but Sheffield City Council does not\nkeep a record of this, and, as such, we do not hold any information for\nthis question.\n3. Over the past twelve months, how many evicted people have been tenants?\nAs stated in Q1, 219 tenants were evicted.\n4. Over the past twelve months, how many evicted tenants have had their\npersonal property disposed of by the local authority?\nFrom Apr 18 to Sept 19 we have stored 20 lots of belongings from evicted\ntenants. Of these, 18 of the lots have been disposed of following the\nsection 41 notice period. However, please note that on some occasions SCC\narea teams have disposed of evicted tenants\u2019 belongings directly due to,\nfor example, the condition of the said goods or the goods being\nperishable, in which case we cannot store them.\n5. Over the past twelve months, how many evicted tenants have had their\npersonal property stored by the local authority?\n20. Please see the explanation for Q4 above.\n6. Over the past twelve months how many evicted ex-licensees have had\ntheir personal property stored by the local authority?\nN/A. Please see our response to Q2 for an explanation.\n7. Over the past twelve months how many evicted ex-Council licensees have\nhad their personal property stored by the local authority?\nN/A. Please see our response to Q2 for an explanation.\n8. Please provide details of the average cost of storing an evicted\npersons personal property?\nThe average cost of storing goods for the required periods is \u00a3125 per\nproperty\n9. Please provide details of the average length of time that evicted\npersons have their personal property stored by the local authority over\nthe past twelve months?\nThe minimum storage period for all goods is 31 days, after which time they\nare disposed of.\n10. Under what circumstances does the local authority protect the personal\nproperty of evicted persons?\nThe Local Authority would keep possessions if the evicted party have\napproached the Local Authority for assistance due to homelessness.\n11. Under what circumstances do the local authority dispose of the\npersonal property of evicted persons?\nThis is done when the section 41 notice period for storage has expired, as\nexplained in Q9 above. Please also note that, as explained in Q4 above,\npersonal property may be disposed of earlier than this if it appears that\nany of the articles are perishable, if any items are pest-ridden and\nstoring them would damage the other items in storage or if looking after\nthem would involve unreasonable expense or inconvenience.\n12. Under what legal basis does the local authority dispose of the\npersonal property of evicted persons?\nSection 41 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.\n13. Please detail when the local authority started disposing of evicted\npersons personal property seven days after eviction?\nThe decision to do this was made approximately 6 years ago. Please note\nthat, as noted in Q4 and Q11 above, there are in any case circumstances in\nwhich property would have to be disposed of earlier than the 31 day period\ndue to the nature or condition of that property.\n14. Please disclose any policy documents or guidance issued to housing\nofficers regarding disposing of personal property left behind by\nex-Council tenants in Council property?\nPlease see the attached guidance documents entitled \u201cEviction Guidance for\nNeighbourhood Teams\u201d and \u201cAbandonment Procedure\u201d.
