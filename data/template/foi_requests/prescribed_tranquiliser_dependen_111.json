                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nFrom April 2013 local authorities were given responsibility by Public Health England for providing drug and alcohol services.\nThis FOI request relates only to those patients who have become addicted or dependent upon tranquilising medications prescribed by their doctors. They do not abuse these or other substances, and were not previously dependent on these or other substances. This group is therefore distinct from illicit drug users.\nCan I please request the following information:\n1. How many referrals have there been to drug and alcohol services in your local authority in the years 2021, 2022, 2023 for treatment for addiction to benzodiazepines, z drug tranquillisers, gabapentinoids and opiods prescribed by their GPs? Please break this down by year, gender and drug.\n2. How many Involuntary Tranquilliser Addicts are currently in treatment provided by your local authority\u2019s drug and alcohol services for addiction to benzodiazepine, z drug tranquillisers, gabapentinoids and opiods prescribed by their GPs? Please break this down by gender and drug.\nCould you please supply your answer in an excel spreadsheet.\nPlease confirm receipt of this email.\nMany thanks,\nRobert Boyd"
