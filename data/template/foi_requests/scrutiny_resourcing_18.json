We\nhave combined them for ease of administrative processing.\nFirst request\nCIPFA Guidance on Local Authority Audit Committees states that\n\u201cRecommended practice is for audit committees to review and assess\nthemselves annually or to seek an external review.\u201d\na) Internal Annual Review of Audit Committee For each of the last five\nfinancial years please provide me with a copy of the audit committee\u2019s\nannual review of its work. Please state the date the review was published\nand how it was made public at the time.\nAnnually the Audit and Standards Committee conduct a review of its work\nand the links are below.

For each of the last 10 financial years,\na) How many full-time officers were allocated to support the council\u2019s\nscrutiny committees and other scrutiny functions?\nMany of our officers are full-time, and many supported the scrutiny\nfunction. These were drawn from policy, democratic and legal services. We\nhave not kept count. However, all the officers who were involved are\nlisted on the reports of the committee which you can find going back to\n2013 on our website here: [5]Committee structure | Sheffield City Council\nAs this information is accessible to you, it is exempt under Section 21.\nb) Please provide a breakdown of all the formal scrutiny committees and\nother scrutiny functions, i.e. task and finish groups, that the officers\nwere allocated to.\nPlease look at our agendas for the Audit Committee (2013-2016) via the\nadvanced search function and the Audit and Standards Committee\n(2016-present) here: [6]Committee structure | Sheffield City Council (and\nsee the exemption in (a))\n2. In each of the years, how many FTE hours were dedicated to supporting\nthe scrutiny process by other officers as required? ie providing legal\nadvice or attending meetings to present reports or answer questions.\nWe do not record this information.\nThird request\nThe independence of scrutiny committees and audit committees has been\nidentified in a number of Public Interest Reports as being an important\nfactor in facilitating meaningful scrutiny and challenge within local\nauthorities.\nAs audit committees are not formally treated as part of scrutiny it may be\nthat they are treated differently in the council\u2019s constitution and\npolicies. Please clarify which committee type your response relates to.\na) Policy on Selection & Appointment of Committee Chairs\nPlease provide the council\u2019s current policy on selection and appointment\nof scrutiny committee chairs and audit committee chairs.\nOur committee is an audit and standards committee.
