                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nHaving recently attended various legal peaceful protests against street tree felling in Sheffield I have been shocked and dismayed along with many others to see so called Evidence Gatherers present. Contrary to Cllr Lodge's assurances that peaceful protesters outside barriers would not be photographed or filmed this has not been the case.  On Vernon road on Monday, 4 evidence gatherers were present for much of the day and although there was no evidence of filming they were marching up and own the road at regular intervals in a menacing manner scrutinising both people and buildings even though no felling was attempted and so no barriers erected. I would like to ask the following;\nWho has sanctioned the evidence gathering against peaceful protesters?\nHas Cllr Lodge gone back on his word re documenting evidence about innocent people going about their business who happen to be in and around areas not closed off for felling?\nWhat are the legal ramifications for SCC re unwarranted surveillance of the citizens of Sheffield?\nDo SCC acknowledge the right of citizens to walk the streets of Sheffield without being intimidated, harassed and followed?\nWould one be right in thinking that it is the council tax payers of Sheffield who are footing the bill for these services?\nHow much so far has been spent on employing such evidence gatherers to date?\nThank you for your time in anticipation of your consideration of these matters.\nYours faithfully,\nAnne Barr"
