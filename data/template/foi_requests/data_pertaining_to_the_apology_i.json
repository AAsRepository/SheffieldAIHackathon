                "Dear Mr Buxton,\nThank you for your Freedom of Information Request Reference 1769966 which\nwe received on 26/2/2025 and for which we sought clarification on\n18/3/2025. You responded to us on 4/4/2025 and we have calculated our\nresponse date from 7/4/2025, which was the next working day. Therefore,\nour response is due on or before 7/5/2025.\nYou have asked us for: \u2018all data associated with the apology made by\nSheffield Tree Action Group on behalf of campaigners, as refer to by Sir\nMark Lowcock in his address to the Sheffield City Council Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting on 10th May 2023\u2019.\nSince you have not indicated any specific information you require, in\norder to answer your request we sought permission from the Data Protection\nOfficer to undertake an e-Discovery search of email systems. This had\nresulted in 428 items identified for the period 6/3/2023 (publication of\nthe Lowcock report) \u2013 10/5/2023 (the reference to the apology in the\nmeeting). There were a further 1,196 items for the period\n11/5/2023-11/8/2023. We felt this to be the most likely period in which\nthe apology made by the Sheffield Tree Action Group (STAG) would be\ndiscussed. Our search used the terms \u2018STAG\u2019 and \u2018apology\u2019.\nWhilst many of these are likely to be repetitious or not relevant: i.e.\nemail threads with multiple recipients or not about the STAG apology (for\nexample the sentence \u2018I have received your meeting apology\u2019 would be\ncaught in our search if the message also mentioned \u2018STAG\u2019) and the\ncouncil\u2019s own apology;\u00a0 we would need to assess each item to determine its\nrelevance to your request and then extract the appropriate item into a\nredactable format. Under Regulation 4(3) of the Fees Regulations we can\ninclude these activities when calculating the cost of compliance. We\nestimate that each item would take an average of five minutes to assess\nand extract: for the first period the 428 items would take 35 hours to\nprocess and the second, up to 100 hours. This calculation does not include\nthe time taken to apply redactions. The Information Commissioner\u2019s\nguidance on this is explained here: [1]Requests where the cost of\ncompliance exceeds the appropriate limit (section 12) | ICO\nThe information you have requested in your request (FOI 1769966) is exempt\nfrom disclosure under section 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on\nthe grounds that cost of compliance would exceed the appropriate limit.\nThe cost limit (18 hours or \u00a3450) is specified in the [2]Freedom of\nInformation and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations\n2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. If you would like to narrow\ndown the focus of your request, we would be happy to process your revised\nrequest as a new request for information under the Freedom of Information\nAct 2000. If there is specific information you are looking for or\ndiscussions between certain individuals, we are happy to conduct further\nsearches to see if we can answer your request.
