We\nendeavour to provide a response to internal reviews within 40 working\ndays. However, a review can sometimes be delayed and I apologise for this.\nI can now confirm that a full and impartial review of the decision made in\nthis case has been conducted with a summary as follows:\nYou contacted the council on 30^th January 2023, requesting information\nrelating to 5G Towers. The response that you received on the 27^th\nFebruary 2023 provided information relating to the questions raised.\nYour email received by the Council on 6^th March 2023 explained that you\nwere requesting an internal review of the above response due to missing\ninformation and lack of clarity around the information provided.\nI have reviewed the details of your complaint and have determined that\nfirstly, the Council is in breach of the timescales required for\nprocessing an internal review. This should have been completed within 40\nworking days,\u00a0 and we have taken nine months to reply. We sincerely\napologise for this but we have had a significant backlog of requests that\nis taking us a long time to get through.\nAddressing the content of your complaint, I can confirm that the position\noutlined in the original response provided should be upheld. SCC doesn\u2019t\nrecord specific information regarding the type of tower (i.e 4G or 5G)\njust that there is a tower. The information that you were provided with as\npart of your initial response was the results of a search of proposals\nwhere the applicant has stated it\u2019s 5G.\nSCC does not hold information relating to questions 2, 3 and 4.\nIf you are dissatisfied with my review, you can make a complaint to the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office: [1][\nemail address\n]\nYours sincerely,\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [2][Sheffield City Council request email]\nThis Email, and any attachments, may contain non-public information and is\nintended solely for the individual(s) to whom it is addressed.
