We sincerely apologise for your frustration\nand you having to complain to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.\nPlease find below a response to your requests:\n- The system used by councillors for logging items of casework received\nfrom constituents\nSince 2022, we have used Microsoft One Note; before that we were using\nExcel spreadsheets.\n- The number of casework items entered by each councillor for the years\n2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe attached list Includes the number of cases raised by individual\nCouncillors for the period 2022-23, but it should be noted that not all\ncases are logged in the Casework system; some Councillors will deal with\ncases themselves.\nEarlier records are proving difficult to extract from. Both 2020 and 2021\nwere during Covid lockdown period where staff did not have access to\ncouncil systems and individual councillors would therefore have managed\ntheir own casework. Our records are patchy and laborious to extract from\nas they are a combination of One Note and Excel spreadsheets. A further\ndisclosure to you will be made imminently.\n- The minimum level of public engagement expected by the council from its\ncouncillors\nWe refer you to the articles of the constitution relating to Members and\nCitizens and the Councillor Code of Conduct to give information which\nmight be considered relevant. Both are published documents, and these are\nthe links to the council webpages:\nConstitution: Article 2 \u2013 Members of the Council:\n[1]\nhttps://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/docum...\nArticle 3 - Citizens & the Council [2]Part 2C - Article 3 - Citizens and\nthe Council 2022.pdf (sheffield.gov.uk)\nCouncillor Code of Conduct:\n[3]\nhttps://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/docum...\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
