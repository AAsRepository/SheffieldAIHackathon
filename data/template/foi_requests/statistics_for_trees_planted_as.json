A single English oak will be positioned at 31 locations\u2026\u201d\nSOURCE:\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/i...\n2)\nThe size and form of nursery stock supplied for planting is defined in Table 1 of BRITISH STANDARD 3936 - PART 1 (1992): 'Nursery stock. Specification for trees and shrubs'. See:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/202008111203...\n3)\nOn the 12th of November 2012, STEVE ROBINSON \u2013 the Sheffield City Council (SCC) Head of Highway Maintenance (responsible for the \u00a32.2bn city-wide \u2018Streets Ahead\u2019 highway maintenance project) and GRAEME SYMONDS \u2013 Network Director for Amey (the contractor acting as service provider for the project) met with Transition Sheffield. They discussed what was going to happen to Sheffield\u2019s street trees, as part of the \u00a32.2bn \u2018Streets Ahead\u2019 project. The minutes state that Messrs Robinson & Symonds informed:\n\u201cIT IS LIKELY THAT UP TO 50% WILL BE REPLACED over the 25 years of the contract, with about 1000 PER YEAR FOR THE FIRST 5 YEARS.\nThe aim is not to denude the city of trees. REPLACEMENT WILL BE WITH SEMI-MATURE TREES WHICH REQUIRE CRANING INTO POSITION, thus speeding up growth and minimising the opportunity for vandalism.\u201d\nSOURCE:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/201911040009...\nhttps://www.transitionsheffield.org.uk.a...\n4)\nItem 3 in the \u2018HIGHWAY TREE REPLACEMENT POLICY\u2019, contained within the Streets Ahead contract (Schedule 29 \u2013 Authority Policies [PDF, 24.5MB] \u2013 pages 36 to 71), states:\n\u201cALL REPLACEMENT TREES WILL BE containerised in 45 or 80 litre pots WITH A GIRTH BETWEEN 12 AND 16 cm. All new plants should be suitably supported until they are sufficiently established and able to stand up un-supported during strong winds.\u201d\nSOURCE:\nhttps://www.sheffield.gov.uk/sites/defau...\nhttps://ianswalkonthewildside.wordpress....\n5)\nOn 27th of February 2016, DAVID CAULFIELD (then responsible for the Streets Ahead felling programme, as the SCC SCC Director of Development Services \u2013 \u2018Place\u2019) signed a witness statement, and submitted it to the High Court (Case No. CO/613/2016). To quote from paragraph 51 of the witness statement: \u201cTHE REPLACEMENT TREES ARE EXTRA HEAVY STANDARD, around 8-10 years old and around 14 to 16 cm girth and 3 metres tall depending on species.\u201d\nSOURCE:\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/t...\n6)\nIn July 2018, Ms Celia Pinnington submitted a Freedom of Information request to SCC, about the aftercare of street trees. She asked: \u201cAre the requirements of Sheffield City Council\u2019s Highway Tree Spacifications section 2.7.3 being adhered to?\u201d:\nhttps://www.sheffield.gov.uk/sites/defau...\n(PDF page 51)\nhttps://ianswalkonthewildside.wordpress....\nThe SCC response:\n\u201cWe can confirm that this is not a contractual document and is for guidance only, appertaining primarily to semi-mature and mature trees planted for instant impact on landscaping schemes, rather than the smaller, EXTRA HEAVY STANDARDS PLANTED WITHIN THE STREETS AHEAD WORKS.\u201d\nSOURCE (Sheffield Tree Action Groups Facebook \u2013 contribution by Ms Pinnington, dated 29th July 2018):\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/202308012211...\nhttps://ianswalkonthewildside.wordpress....\nYours faithfully,\nMr Long"
