Themes\nof cultural sensitivity, diversity and inclusion were included in the\npackages, but also linked to wider mandatory equalities training. In\naddition, this year we have introduced, a number Modern Slavery seminars,\ndelivered by guest speakers from South Yorkshire Police. The first of\nthese was delivered during safeguarding week and we have two other\nsessions planned between January and July. We have attached the power\npoint used during the first session.\nPlease note that the names of individuals have been redacted under section\n40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on the grounds that these are\npersonal data and disclosure would contravene the data protection\nprinciple under Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation\nthat processing of personal data must be fair, lawful and transparent.\nQuestion:\nWhere held, please share copies of training materials used to support\ncouncil staff in identifying modern slavery (such as PDFs, guidance, or\npresentations)\nAnswer:\nWe have recently changed our online learning provider and couldn\u2019t bring\nwith us the modern slavery training package we previously used. We are\ncurrently appraising options to replace this and hopefully will have an\ne-learning package available in the not-too-distant future.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
