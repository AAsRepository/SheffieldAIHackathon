                "Dear Karolina Kalisz,\nThank you for your request for information relating to specialist school\nplacements requested and agreed to in 2022-2024 by child's ethnicity which\nwe received on 02/04/2025.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1.\u00a0The information you have requested is exempt from disclosure under\nsection 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Sheffield City\nCouncil does hold the information you have requested. However, we do\nnot record the information in a format that allows us to produce an\nelectronic report of this. Therefore, we would have to carry out a\nmanual search of our records. Parental preference for placement is\nheld alongside all other supporting documentation which is in paper\nformat. This is e-filed on an individual basis for each child. From\n2022 \u2013 Present Day we have finalised around 3220 plans. We estimate\nthat we would need to search 3220 records and that it would take 6\nminutes to search each record. Therefore, it would take us 322 hours\nto collate the information, which is more than the cost limit of 18\nhours or \u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data\nProtection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No.\n3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. If you would like to narrow\ndown the focus of your request, we would be happy to process your revised\nrequest as a new request for information under the Freedom of Information\nAct 2000.\n2.\u00a0Please see above response.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
