                "Dear N Hussain,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Funding for the\nDarnall Ward which we received on 17/05/2024.\nThe information you have requested is exempt from disclosure under section\n12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our\nrecords. We are unable to identify specific funding that is for the\nDarnall Ward.\u00a0Lots of council services and funding will support\nactivities, this includes activities happening in the Darnall ward,\nalongside other areas. It is impossible to work out what proportion is for\nthat ward in particular.\u00a0We do not have the systems in place to allow us\nto pull all funding into once place, as this is allocated from different\nservices across the organisation. A search of records across the\norganisation would exceed the cost limit of 18 hours or \u00a3450 specified in\nthe [1]Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and\nFees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters.
