We would then work with the landlord / agent to ensure the\ncomplaint is resolved, if this is not possible then we would move to\nformal enforcement action should it be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 Where the evidence, on\nthe balance of probabilities, suggests that the management of the\nproperty, or its condition, falls below the Snug standards, the case will\nbe referred to our officer panel which meets monthly.\u00a0 That panel may\ndecide to warn the member, to suspend them for a limited period pending\nfurther review, or to revoke their membership altogether.\n- the number of complaints received by private housing standards regarding\nPurpose Built Student Accomodation since 2020? Please give a breakdown by\nprovider and reason\nWe do not have a record of the total number of complaints of all kinds\nthat\u00a0have been received in relation to all Snug properties.\u00a0 All\ncomplaints are recorded, considered and dealt with as outlined above but\nthey are not categorised in such a way as enables us to calculate a total\nspecifically for Snug properties. \u00a0\u00a0We are able to see how many complaints\nhave been received in relation to a particular property or landlord and\nthis informs the action that is taken in relation to a particular landlord\nor property, however, not all complaints or reports are proven, and we\ncannot provide a breakdown by provider to the public.\nOur experience is that we receive significantly fewer complaints about\nSnug properties than private rented properties generally, which is as we\nwould expect given that it is unlikely that landlords with poor properties\nand management standards will apply for Snug.\u00a0 However, despite this we\nhave still refused Snug membership or revoked the membership of 18\nlandlords.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.

Your request concerned complaints received\nconnected to Houses in multiple occupation.\nWe don\u2019t believe we would be able to provide the information you are\nasking for under section 12 of the Act. Sheffield City Council does hold\nthe information you have requested. But our system logs service request\ncases under the address, and there isn\u2019t a way for us to filter through\nthe cases for those years into the categories that you have asked for. We\nlog all our service requests under the same action code on our system.\nThere are a few codes that differentiate cases but the majority fall under\nthe same one or two codes, which is why it would take a manual check per\nrecord to identify if the property is a licenced HMO property, and whether\nit would fall under one of the categories in your request.\nWe estimate that we would need to search 1400 records and that it would\ntake three minutes to search each record. That would take us 70 hours to\ncollate the information, which is more than the cost limit of 18 hours or\n\u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data Protection\n(Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. We do not produce reports of\nthe type you require so specific as to the type of property or issue. If\nthere\u2019s a need to focus on a certain issue, for example Damp and Mould, we\nmay report on that, but again we wouldn\u2019t report at the level of a single\nfamily let or an HMO, etc.\nPotentially, you could reduce the number of properties to search through,\nor you could identify a specific property / properties to look at.
