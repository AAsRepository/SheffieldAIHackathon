                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI am getting in touch under the Freedom of Information Act.\nAn email was sent from the Local Government Association (LGA) and the Department of Education on December 5 2018 to all local authorities to \u201cdraw attention\u201d to a \u201cbuilding failure\u201d involving a property constructed with RAAC. It suggested steps that local authorities should take the following steps:\n\"(1) identify any properties constructed using Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) and validate the potential risk appropriately\n(2) consider and monitor the possible impact of reduced maintenance regimes on the condition of your property portfolio, in particular where RAAC is used.\"\n1. a) Please disclose any action taken and/or findings made as a result of this email regarding point 1. This could include any surveys, studies or reports commissioned to identify properties constructed using RAAC and their results, including which properties were found to contain RAAC, and the potential risk that was assessed.\nb) Please disclose any action taken and/or findings made as a result of this email regarding point 2. This could include any buildings in your property portfolio that you identified as having been built with RAAC that had \u201creduced maintenance regimes\u201d.\n2. Please disclose copies of any reports, surveys, briefings or studies concerning the presence of RAAC in your property portfolio after this email from December 5 2018.\n3. If you replied to this email from the LGA, or forwarded it to another member of staff internally, please disclose the subsequent email chains.\n4. Please disclose any other actions taken as a result of this email, if not included above.\nYours faithfully,\nRuby Lott-Lavigna"

This could include any surveys,\nstudies or reports commissioned to identify properties constructed using\nRAAC and their results, including which properties were found to contain\nRAAC, and the potential risk that was assessed.\nThe Council has commissioned external consultants who will undertake a\nrisk-based approach to identifying asset that have the potential for\ncontaining RAAC. Surveys are currently being planned to be undertaken on\nthe corporate assets (including Housing property types). The timescale for\ncompleting these surveys is 18 months but still in development.\nb) Please disclose any action taken and/or findings made as a result of\nthis email regarding point 2. This could include any buildings in your\nproperty portfolio that you identified as having been built with RAAC that\nhad \u201creduced maintenance regimes\u201d.\nThe majority of Sheffield\u2019s housing stock is of traditional construction\nand subject to a programme of continual upgrade and maintenance e.g.\nroofing, windows and building fabric, kitchens, and insulation. We are\ncurrently undertaking a RAAC survey investigation into the portfolio to\nensure housing and associated communal buildings and plantrooms are RAAC\nfree.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please disclose copies of any reports, surveys, briefings\nor studies concerning the presence of RAAC in your property portfolio\nafter this email from December 5, 2018.\nThere are no reports or surveys that have been undertaken on the council\nHousing stock since December 2018.
