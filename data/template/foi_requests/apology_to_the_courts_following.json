                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI am making a formal request for information regarding the apology the Council said it would make to the Courts following the publication of the Independent Inquiry into the Street Tree Dispute by Sir Mark Lowcock. At the Strategy and Resources Committee on the 19 June 2023 the Council accepted in full the recommendations of a report by the Chief Executive that included at para 18 a statement that the Council would apologise to the Courts. Despite my repeated emails asking whether this would be made public and for details of when and to whom the apology has been made, I have received no reply.\nI consider the following requested information to be strongly in the public interest given the nature of the dispute, the criticisms by Sir Mark on the Councils ability to be open and honest and the protracted failure to reply to my reasonable requests. It would appear the Council has something to hide in this matter.\nThe information I seek would be generated in the period from the 6th March 2023 to the date of your response.\nI have used the word 'Courts' as this is what the Council used - please take this to mean any Court or Judicial body in regards to an apology.\nThe information I am seeking is as follows;\n1. Has an apology been issued to the Courts and if so, the date(s) and address(es) to which it(they) was sent.\n2. The text of any such apology made or a copy of the apology or apologies to the Courts.\n3. All emails internal or external relating to the arrangements for, text of, legal opinion or advice about and authorisations for, said apology as specified in the Chief Exec's report of 19 June 2023. Specifically the arrangements were to be overseen by James Henderson and the Chief Exec but may fall to David Hollis (Interim General Council and Monitoring Officer)\n4. Are any emails as specified in point 3 above marked as (or not included in your response to this FOI due to being) restricted or excluded from disclosure by way of legal privilege?\n5. Have any replies or responses been received from the Courts?\n6. Copies or text of any replies received from the Courts.\nYours faithfully,\nPaul Brooke"
