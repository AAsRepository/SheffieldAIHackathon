However the link takes me to a page that says I am not authorised to view it. I am registered with the Mercell Portal and can access the site successfully and view other opportunities, past and present.\nTherefore I am still unable to establish that the opportunity was advertised, leading to my request in the first place.\nHaving alerts in place that notify our business of any such opportunities should mean that we would have been alerted to this particular opportunity, and we would have bid, however we did not receive any notifications. It also seems unusual that only 1 bid was received. Was this advert restricted in any way?\nCan you provide proof of the advert by another means?\nMany thanks\nYours sincerely,\nSai Parker"
