Factors in favour of disclosure are that disclosure\npromotes openness and transparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the\nexemption are that there is a public interest in allowing public\nauthorities to withhold information which, if disclosed, would reduce its\ncontractors\u2019 ability to negotiate or compete in a commercial environment.\nOn balance, the Council believes that the public interest lies in\nmaintaining the exemption.\nWhat internal resource (FTE) was devoted to the design, implementation,\nand training to enable your organisation to go live with its LocalGov\nDrupal website(s)/CMS?\nThe website is managed by the Digital Services Team, who are currently 8\nFTE\nWhat internal resource (FTE) is devoted to the maintenance, development\nand hosting of your LocalGov Drupal website(s)/CMS?\nThe website is managed by the Digital Services Team, who are currently 8\nFTE\nCost of the website/CMS that immediately preceded your LocalGov Drupal\nwebsite(s)/CMS:\nWhat was the spend with suppliers for the design, implementation, and\ntraining to enable your organisation to go live with your website solution\nthat immediately preceded your LocaGov Drupal website(s)/CMS?\nS43 as above\nWhat is the annual spend with suppliers for the maintenance, development\nand hosting of the solution that immediately preceded your LocaGov Drupal\nwebsite(s)/CMS?\nS43 as above.\nWhat internal resource (FTE) was devoted to the design, implementation,\nand training to enable your organisation to go live with the solution that\nimmediately preceded your LocaGov Drupal website(s)/CMS?\nThe website was managed by the Digital Services Team who at the time were\n7 FTE\nWhat internal resource (FTE) is devoted to the maintenance, development\nand hosting of the solution that immediately preceded your LocalGov Drupal\nwebsite(s)/CMS?\nThe website was managed by the Digital Services Team who at the time were\n7 FTE\nDue diligence:\nWhat soft market testing or other market evaluation did your organisation\nundertake prior to selecting the LocalGov Drupal Solution?\nThe contract is a Call Off via Crown Commercial Services G-Cloud framework\nin which framework guidance is followed.\nPlease outline how many bidders were invited to bid for the design,\nimplementation, training, development, maintenance and hosting of your\norganisation\u2019s LocalGov Drupal website(s)/CMS, and the pricing that each\nsupplier quoted.\n3 bids were received.\nSection 43 provides information is exempt if its disclosure would, or\nwould likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person (which\nincludes a company). The disclosure of this information may prejudice the\ncompany\u2019s commercial interests as it would reveal information about the\nprice they are willing to accept for this project.\nSection 43 is a qualified exemption and subject to a public interest test\nto consider whether it is in the public interest to maintain the exemption\nor to disclose the information.\nPublic interest arguments in favour of disclosing the information\nThere is always interest in the way public authorities spend money. In the\ncurrent financial climate, there is greater need to ensure public money is\nbeing spent on the right services and activities whilst getting the best\nvalue.\nThe Council does, wherever lawful and possible, disclose information about\nthe money it spends, the decisions it makes and the activities it carries\nout because it helps to:\n\u2022\u00a0Improve public awareness and allow members of the public to engage in\npublic debate about decisions and initiatives affecting the locality\n\u2022\u00a0Promote accountability and transparency in the way public money is\nspent and the process behind contracting services\n\u2022\u00a0Encourage other potential suppliers to bid for contracts, leading to\ngreater competition, and possibly decreasing the cost to the Council\nPublic interest arguments in favour of maintaining the exemption\nThe tender process is a critical process in determining what services can\nbe acquired. It is a process that requires interested parties to bid for\nwork and to be clear about what services can be offered and delivered with\nagreed timescales and at what cost.\nThe Council understands the need for transparency and openness, but also\nneeds to weigh up the impact of disclosing information about other\norganisations, which in this case might:\n\u2022\u00a0Result in legal action if the organisation wishes to pursue a breach\nof confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality is well established in\nlaw and there is a strong interest in confidence being maintained\n\u2022\u00a0Impact on the organisation\u2019s ability to compete in a competitive\nmarket because information about a bidding failure may hit commercial\nor public confidence in the firm. This may result in the loss of\nbusiness the company receives together with its ability to obtain\nsupplies or secure finance, and in more extreme cases, jobs.\n\u2022\u00a0Discourage companies to bid for future work with the Council amid\nconcerns that information will be disclosed despite their wishes,\nwhich may result in fewer choices and higher costs for the Council.\n\u2022\u00a0Prejudice the commercial interests of the Council by affecting\nadversely its bargaining position during contractual negotiations\nwhich would result in the less effective use of public money.\n\u2022\u00a0Reduce tender submissions if businesses disengage from the bidding\nprocess if they consider they are unable to compete with the disclosed\nbidders in any other future process.\nBalance of the public interest arguments\nOn consideration of the points above, we believe the public interest in\nmaintaining the exemption outweighs the interest in disclosing the\ninformation and therefore have decided that the information should be\nrefused.\nPlease outline how many bidders were invited to bid for the design,\nimplementation, training, development, maintenance and hosting of your\norganisation\u2019s website(s)/CMS using a software platform other than\nLocalGov Drupal and the pricing that each supplier quoted.\nS43 as above.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
