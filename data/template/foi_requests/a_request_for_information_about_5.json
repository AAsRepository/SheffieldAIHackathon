(As an EV driver I know that many have been out of order for considerable periods - this can easily be confirmed on 'Zap Map'))\n(e) On how many occasions have any sanctions been used in 2023 and first quarter 2024?\n(f) If, as a recent Councillor's answer to a Public Question states (Cllr Miskell, 13 March Transport etc. Committee),  'the contract is under constant review':\n(i) how many breaches of contractual requirements could or would trigger the removal of the current provider?\n(ii) in such a circumstance, what would happen to the currently installed machines?\nYours faithfully,\nRussell Johnson"

                "Dear Russell Johnson,\nThank you for your request for information relating to SCC's Contract with\n'Raw' for EV Chargers which we received on 03/04/2024.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request below:\n(a) Does SCC monitor the performance of the provider in terms of their\ndevice's periods of functioning and otherwise? SCC have a back-office\nsystem that shows when the machines are online / offline. Rest of the\ninformation is provided monthly through RAW.\n(b) If so, how is this data collected - does the Council rely on\nself-reporting by the company? The data is collected and recorded in a\nexcel document with graphs to highlight usage / up times / repairs /\ncomplaints, this show how much usage and how much income is set to be\nreceived. This is presented by RAW Contracts manager to the SCC Operations\nManager that deals with the contract.\n(c) If relevant data is available:\n(i) in calendar years 2022, 2023 and first quarter 2024, how many of the\nrelevant devices have been out of service and for what lengths of time?\nPlease see table below.\n(ii) how many devices over the same period have been out of service for\nlonger than the contract stipulates - i.e. five days? Please see table\nbelow.\n(d) Where chargers have not been restored to functioning within the\ncontractual requirement, what sanctions have been applied? (As an EV\ndriver I know that many have been out of order for considerable periods -\nthis can easily be confirmed on 'Zap Map')) Please see table below.\n(e) On how many occasions have any sanctions been used in 2023 and first\nquarter 2024?

If we do keep getting failures within the\ncontracts, we charge the supplier a penalty cost for not meeting KPI\u2019s.\nRAW took over from Franklin when they went out of business, so a lot of\nthe issues are inherited, and we do want to work on this relationship\nrather than look for a new supplier.\n(i) how many breaches of contractual requirements could or would trigger\nthe removal of the current provider? This depends on the contractual\nagreement, at the moment there are small issues which are working together\nto resolve.\n(ii) in such a circumstance, what would happen to the currently installed\nmachines? Last time we changed suppliers it was Franklin going out of\nbusiness and RAW buying the contents, our understanding would be if we\nused another supplier, such as Blink that supply our Fast Chargers, they\nwould install their own chargers and RAW would take their chargers back.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
