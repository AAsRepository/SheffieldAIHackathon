                "1 Attachment\nFOI 934970 The Forge Works Required.doc\n82K\nDownload\nView as HTML\nDear Matt Smith\nWe regret the delay in responding to your request of 1 October 2023 which\nwas due on 30 October 2023. We had all the information on 2 November 2023\nbut omitted to send it to you. We sincerely apologise for your frustration\nand you having to complain to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.\nThe Snug scheme is a partnership by the council and universities for\nmonitoring and regulation of student housing in Sheffield. We do not\ncompile inspection reports as part of the Snug scheme. We note hazards and\nissues that do not meet the standards and raise them with the\nlandlord/managing agent.\nThe Snug property and management standards also provide an inspection\nstandard:\n[1]snug_property_and_management_standards_from_1_august_2023_0.pdf\n(sheffield.gov.uk)\nWe are attaching a copy of a letter where work is required. Following each\ninspection, a letter is sent either passing the property as no work is\nrequired or requesting work to be undertaken. Once the work has been\ncompleted and checked off another letter is sent passing the property. We\nhave removed personal data under Section 40(2) of the Act because it would\notherwise be a breach of the data protection principles.\nPotentially 54 letters (i.e., two letters each for 27 blocks of\naccommodation) could have gone out. It is impossible to know exact numbers\nthat required work without entering each account on our database, and then\nreviewing each file. We estimate this would take 27 hours which would\nexceed the cost of compliance of 18 hours. That is because we would have\nto review ethe records for each block and retrieve and extract the\ninformation. If you want to pursue this interest, please consider a\nnarrower focus for your request for information.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
