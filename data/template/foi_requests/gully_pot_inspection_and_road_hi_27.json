For example, an inspected gully pot can be 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% filled with silt. Local authorities store these inspection records in a spreadsheet. I therefore wish to request for your silt level data from January 2017 to December 2021\nFor Road Hierarchy Data:\nIn the UK, local authority roads are classed as rural and urban and further reclassified based on hierarchy (or categories) such as motorway, strategic route, main distributor roads, secondary distributor, local distributor etc. For example: Page 33 of South Gloucestershire's Asset Management Framework document (Highways-Asset-Management-Framework2015-2020.pdf (southglos.gov.uk)) shows an example of a local authority's road hierarchy (categories).
