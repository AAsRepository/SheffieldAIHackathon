                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI'd like to request any impact assessment made by the council in relation to strike action by workers at Veolia. Specifically the impact on recycling services in Sheffield since the start of the action in August 2024. I'm particularly interested in any assessment made on the effect on volumes of waste recycled as a result of the closure of recycling bring sites and any impact on carbon emissions.\nYours faithfully,\nAaron Walters"
