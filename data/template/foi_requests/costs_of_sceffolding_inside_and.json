                "Dear Caroline Dewar,\nThank you for your request for information relating to costs of\nscaffolding inside and outside the Rose Garden Caf\u00e9 which we received on\n26/10/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1.\u00a0Regarding the scaffolding/propping inside and outside the Rose Garden\nCaf\u00e9, how much is it costing a month to keep the scaffolding in place\nand what is the total that has been paid for this up to date?\nThe interior and exterior scaffolding to Rose Garden Caf\u00e9 was\ninitially hired for 12 weeks from December 2022. The total cost of\ninstalling and hiring the scaffolding for this 12 week period was \u00a361,008.\nThis included the costs for the legally required weekly inspections.\nAfter the initial 12 week hire, it was determined that the scaffold would\nneed to be in place for a substantial period. The scaffolding supplier\nquoted \u00a36,800 per month to continue hiring the scaffolding. We asked the\nsupplier to allow us to purchase the scaffold instead. The supplier was\nunwilling to sell the scaffolding but agreed that we could pay a one-off\nhire fee of \u00a350,000, allowing us to hire the scaffolding for the duration\nof the project. Upon project completion the scaffolding would be returned\nto the supplier.\nThe \u00a350,000 did not include for the weekly inspection costs and the\nscaffolding supplier undertook two further inspections of the scaffolding\non 29/05/23 and 05/06/23 at the cost of \u00a3300.\nThe total paid to the scaffolding supplier is \u00a3111,308.\nSince 05/06/23, we have undertaken the mandatory inspections costing\n\u00a326.17 per inspection totalling \u00a3197.23 to date.\nThe total spent on the scaffolding to date is \u00a3111,505.23\n2.\u00a0We have heard that the scaffolding etc has been purchased by SCC. Can\nyou confirm that this is the case and if so, how much did the Council\npay for it?\nPlease see reply to question 1 above\n3.\u00a0Can you confirm who in the council, as in which department, is\ncovering the costs for all of this?\nFacilities Management Revenue Budget\n4.\u00a0Can you confirm that these costs will NOT be charged to the Graves\nPark Trust, nor deducted from the Graves Park Trust's accounts?\nSee response to question 3.
