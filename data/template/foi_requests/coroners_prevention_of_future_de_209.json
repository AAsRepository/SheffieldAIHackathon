                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nThank you for sharing the link to the Judiciary website. However, this response does not provide access to the information that is being requested due to the following reasons:\n1. The Judiciary website contains coroners' Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs) that have been sent by coroners or the local coroner's office to the Chief Coroner's Office for publication. It, therefore, does not contain all PFDs that Sheffield City Council has directly received from coroners as requested.\n2. The search function on the Judiciary website is not sophisticated enough to account for the spelling errors and inconsistencies in reporting recipients' names that result from the manual publication of reports and reports aren't catalogued or standardised by addressees.\n3. The Judiciary website is only 'searchable' for reports dated from January 2023 onwards, when the Chief Coroner's Office started publishing the full text of reports online. Therefore, the request for the total number of PFDs where Sheffield City Council was copied for information as an \u2018interested person\u2019 from inception (July 2013) is not accessible from the link shared nor via simply searching.\nThe initial request did not seek copies of each PFD received; rather, it requested a summarised count of the total number of PFDs where Sheffield City Council was a listed addressee and copied for information as an interested person. Can I please re-request this information for from July 2013 until June 2024, broken down as annual counts for each calendar year?\nYours faithfully,\nDr Georgia Richards"
