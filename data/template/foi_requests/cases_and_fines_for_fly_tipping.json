The following data has been extracted from our Confirm database for all\nfly tipping enquiries attached to Sheffield Wards, relating to our Parks\nand Countryside service:\nYear\nWard 2020 2021 2022 2023\nArbourthorne 16 60 27 19\nBeauchief & Greenhill 10 22 12 13\nBeighton 14 16 6 11\nBirley 35 31 28 17\nBroomhill 6 6 5 6\nBurngreave 352 363 186 108\nCentral 19 19 14 27\nCrookes 12 13 13 8\nDarnall 56 61 54 22\nDore & Totley 14 10 7 8\nEast Ecclesfield 36 40 22 16\nEcclesall 28 20 11 22\nFirth Park 79 136 74 74\nFulwood 5 11 5 9\nGleadless Valley 24 37 22 31\nGraves Park 3 10 1\nHillsborough 15 23 18 11\nManor Castle 74 88 60 48\nMosborough 31 38 35 24\nNether Edge 7 13 8 1\nRichmond 14 29 17 14\nShiregreen & Brightside 147 212 127 63\nSouthey 54 85 64 30\nStannington 66 56 26 16\nStocksbridge & Upper Don 33 29 27 16\nWalkley 39 42 26 37\nWest Ecclesfield 42 39 31 26\nWoodhouse 30 17 14 17\nGrand Total 1261 1526 939 695\n2. We are attaching a report with the breakdown of area for reports of\nfly-tipping from our Environmental Protection Service. By postcode was the\nonly way the system would allow, and some of the data isn\u2019t complete due\nto addresses not being fully verified at the time.\nWe are unable to do the breakdown by ward with Fixed Penalty Notices and\nfines as that is a separate part of the system, and we only log the\naddress of the person who is fined not the location of the fly-tipping. To\ndo otherwise, would require searching through all 660 records and logging\nmanually which could take between 2-5 mins per record depending on how the\ninformation is presented. Under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the Environmental\nInformation Regulations 2004 we think this would be manifestly\nunreasonable as it could take up to 55 hours.\nRegulation 12(4)(b) is subject to a public interest test. Factors in\nfavour of disclosure are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it\nis not in the public interest to spend such a large amount of officer time\non providing this information, as this would come at a large cost to the\ncouncil and would divert officers from being able to carry out other work.\nOn balance, the council believes that the public interest lies in\nmaintaining the exception.\nWe would be able to provide a breakdown of the postal area of those fined.\nIf you are still dissatisfied with the handling of your request, you can\nask the Information Commissioner for a decision: [1][\nemail address\n]\nKind regards\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [2][Sheffield City Council request email]\nThis Email, and any attachments, may contain non-public information and is\nintended solely for the individual(s) to whom it is addressed.

                "Dear FOI,\nIf you look at my original request, I asked for a summary based on each Ward. You have sent me information based on different services, which I did not ask for. How many different services are there for which fly-tipping falls under and what are the names of these services? You said you sent me information based on the Highways Maintenance Service originally but the latest information (which you said was from your Environmental Protection Service) has the same data as the original re: FPN's and Fines. Can you clarify why these are the same or have you made an error in providing this information to me?\nI disagree with your conclusion re: not being able to disclose the information of the FPN's and Fines by Ward. This is extremely important to disclose and is much needed for openness and transparency. This is in the public interest and withholding this information goes against this. Fly-tipping in Sheffield and around the UK is a major public health concern and so I would ask that you reconsider this decision and provide the requested information. Providing the postcode of those fined is not the same as fines related to the location of the fly-tipping offences, but please can you send this anyway.\nYours sincerely,\nN. Hussain"
