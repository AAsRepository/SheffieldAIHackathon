I\nwas not party to the original decision on whether the information you\nrequested should be released. Please take this letter as the response to\nyour Internal Review.\nThe intention of an internal review is to consider if we handled your\nresponse in accordance with the law and to consider if any decisions made,\nfor example to refuse information, were correct and still apply.\nIn my review of the processing of this request I have considered:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your original request\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The response to your request\nTime for Compliance\nSection 10 \u2013 Time for compliance with request\n([1]\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000...\n)\nSection 10 of the Freedom of Information Act states that Sheffield City\nCouncil must respond to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act\nwithin 20 working days of receipt. In this case, your request was received\nby Sheffield City Council on 4^th March 2015 which was responded to on\n4^th March 2015 in a letter from Mark Knight, Information Management\nOfficer and followed up with an email to whatdotheyknow.com for this case\non the 6^th March 2015. This response was provided within 20 working days,\ntherefore, I am satisfied that Section 10 of the Freedom of Information\nAct was correctly complied with in this case.\nThe exemption(s) which were applied to the information you requested\nSection 14 \u2013 Vexatious requests\n([2]\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000...\n)\nHave the exemptions been correctly applied in this case?\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 14 (1) \u2013 Vexatious requests\nThe explanation why this exemption applied was provided to you in your\noriginal response as detailed in full in our letter of the 4^th March\n2015.\nAlthough section 14(1) of the FOIA is not in Part II \u2018Exempt Information\u2019\nof the FOIA, its application has the effect of enabling a public authority\nto refuse to supply information that has been requested under the FOIA and\nso we have\ndescribed this section as an \u2018exemption\u2019.\nThe starting point for the consideration of internal reviews is to\ndetermine whether the exemptions cited in refusal letters are engaged and,\nif so, whether, in respect of non-absolute exemptions, the public interest\ntest has been applied correctly.\nWe have considered your request in accordance with the Information\nCommissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) guidance on vexatious requests. Having\nundertaken such consideration when handling your initial request and under\nthis review we are firmly of the view that your request is vexatious and\nsection 14(1) was applied correctly for the reasons set out in our letter\nof 4^th March 2015.\nLink to the ICO\u2019s guidance:\n[3]\nhttps://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisatio...\nApplication of the Public Interest Test\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act 2000, there are two types of\nexemption, \u201cQualified Exemptions\u201d and \u201cAbsolute Exemptions\u201d. When applying\nan exemption to information that is requested, if the exemption is a\n\u201cQualified Exemption\u201d, then we are required to carry out a Public Interest\nTest. If any exemption applies which is \u201cAbsolute\u201d, there is no\nrequirement for us to carry out a Public Interest Test.\nIn relation to your request, Section 14 is not subject to a Public\nInterest Test.\nResponse to further comments in your request for review\nWithin your request for review you noted some specific concerns as\ndetailed below and responded to:\nI am asking pertinent questions that scrutinize the council as is my right\nunder the tenant involvement and empowerment standard and under the\nfreedom of information act.\nThe application of Section 14 removes the requirement to provide\ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act. Other standards do not\nimpact on the disclosure decision made under FOI.\nI have made a total of 27 freedom of information requests since June 2014.\nThat is an average of 2.7 requests per month or just over 1 every\nfortnight. I do not think this is unreasonable.\nThe ICO guidance noted about does allow the Council to consider the\naggregated impact of requests as noted in point 56:\n56. A request which would not normally be regarded as vexatious in\nisolation may assume that quality once considered in context. An example\nof this would be where an individual is placing a significant strain on an\nauthority\u2019s resources by submitting a long and frequent series of\nrequests, and the most recent request, although not obviously vexatious in\nitself, is contributing to that aggregated burden.\nThe method of determining this aggregated burden is not specifically\ndefined by the ICO and therefore the Council defines what it feels is a\nburden upon it.\nMy requests do overlap only slighty because I'm trying to get to the\nbottom of the CCTV install at Brightmore Drive. However I have not\nrepeated the same request once it has been refused. By asking about\nGo-lacal\" funding, \"privacy impact assemsments\" and the \"IKMT\" I am\nkeeping my requests focussed on the issue without repeating the same\nquestions more than once. I do not think my requests overlap and all of\nthese requests are pertinent to an investigation in to the conditions that\nresulted in the CCTV installation.\nAs detailed with our letter of the 4^th March 2015 we believe that grounds\nare sufficient to make this and associated requests vexatious as confirmed\nin this internal review.\nI wish to challenge the determiniation that my requests are vexatious. I\nunderstand that you do not wish to answer these questions because they are\nembarrasing for the council, however you are required by law to answer my\nrequests.\nThe application of Section 14 removes the requirement to provide\ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act. The reasons for our\nrefusal were clearly outlined in our letter of the 4^th March 2015,\nembarrassment was not a factor in our decision making process.\nThe reasons you have stated for determining my requests to be vexasious\nnumbers 1-7 are false. The council cannot hide behind this exemption to\navoid answering ligitimate questions from concerned members of the public.\nThe application of Section 14 removes the requirement to provide\ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act.\nReview Decision - Conclusion\nTaking the above into account, I am satisfied that the following exemption\napplies to the information that you have requested:\no\u00a0Section 14\nIn conclusion, it is my view that your Freedom of Information request has\nbeen handled correctly and within the legal requirements of the Freedom of\nInformation Act 2000.\nI realise this is not the decision that you would wish, but I hope you can\nunderstand why I have upheld the original refusal to provide you with the\ndetails you have requested.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the outcome, you are entitled to contact the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office and they will consider whether your\ncomplaint is eligible for further review. The Information Commissioner\u2019s\ndetails and guidance is available on the website at [4]www.ico.org.uk.\nYours sincerely,\nCharlotte Mead\nHousing Co-ordinator (Housing Freedom of Information and Subject Access\nRequests)\nInformation and Knowledge Management Team\nResources, Sheffield City Council\nTelephone: 0114 2930000\nWebsite:\nwww.sheffield.gov.uk\n_____________________________________________\nFrom: M.
