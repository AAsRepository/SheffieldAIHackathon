                "1 Attachment\nRE FOI 2020 2021 3027 ICO 159669 K9T5 Redacted.pdf\n977K\nDownload\nView as HTML\nDear Mr Combie\nThank you for the meta request of 1 July 2022 regarding our handling of\nyour request FOI / 2020-21-3027, which was about the documentation of any\ndecision to use \u201cNot Subject to FOI\u201d on council emails. We apologise for\nthe delay in our response which was due on 29 July 2022. We have a\npandemic-induced backlog of requests, which has caused delays.\nWe are attaching the emails relating to this request and our response.\nThe redacted information on page 1 is out of scope.\nWe have removed personal information about more junior staff from email\nheaders and signatures. Section 40(2) exempts information in response to a\nrequest if it is personal data belonging to an individual other than\nyourself and it satisfies one of the conditions listed in the\nlegislation.(1) The condition contained in section 40(3A)(a) applies, that\ndisclosure would breach one of the data protection principles. The\nprinciple is that, \u201cPersonal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and\nin a transparent manner...\u201d (2) We do not consider that disclosing this\ninformation to you, and consequently the public, is necessary or justified\nin order to satisfy your information request and the requirements of the\nFOIA. In the circumstances of this request there is no strong legitimate\ninterest that would override the prejudice to the rights and freedoms of\nthe data subject/s. We have therefore taken the decision that disclosing\nthis information to you would be unlawful.\n(1) Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 contained in the\nData Protection Act 2018.\n(2) GDPR EU2016, Article 5(1)(a).\nThere are two statements on page 8 we have redacted under section\n36(2)(b)(i) because they contain opinions by a council officer about the\nhandling of your request, the disclosure of which would be likely to,\ninhibit the free and frank provision of advice.\nThe opinions were supplied under the assumption that they would not be\nreleased to the world at large. Initial views and formulations are\ntendered as part of a process of internal scrutiny and validation before\nbeing finally provided the requester. They are not necessarily accurate\nand may give a misleading impression of the true situation.\u00a0 The\ndisclosure of these opinions would be likely to have a direct impact, both\nnow and in the future, on an officer\u2019s ability to debate these issues in a\nfree and frank manner and the process by which this discussion takes\nplace.\nThe public interest in the disclosure of the information is the principle\nof the accountability and transparency of public authorities and their\ndecision-making processes. It would allow individuals to further\nunderstand and participate in the issues debated.\nThe public interest in the maintenance of the exemption is the provision\nof a safe space that allows officers to contribute to discussions without\nconcern about what may or may not be disclosed publicly. Without this,\nparticipants may be reluctant to offer free and frank advice or share\nconcerns.\nOn balance, we do not consider it in the public interest to disclose this\ninformation because of the \u2018chilling effect\u2019, which is that disclosure of\ndiscussions would inhibit free and frank discussions in the future, and\nthat the loss of frankness and candour would damage the quality of advice\nand deliberation and lead to poorer decision-making.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [1]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an\ninternal review by replying to this email. Internal review requests should\nbe submitted within 40 working days from the date of this response.\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you\ncan contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.
