                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nThank you in advance for your time answering this request.  I am interested in knowing about the Council's digitisation of Playground inspections, as per Westminster Government's push for Local Councils to move to a digital approach for managing its assets and tasks, and its affect on budgets.\nI would like to know how many Playground and/or Play Area inspections  are carried out each week for public Playgrounds / Play Areas you are responsible for?  Also, are these inspections completed by an in-house Council team or are they conducted by a contracted 3rd party company?\nDoes the Council use digital play inspection software for recording and managing these inspections?  If yes, which software is used and how much does it cost the Council on an annual basis for this solution.\nYours faithfully,\nJames Taylor"
