                "1 Attachment\nEmail of 18 February 2020 Redacted.pdf\n285K\nDownload\nView as HTML\nDear Mr Combie\nThank you for your request of 27 December 2020 relating to the\ncommunication of a records retention policy by Steve Eccleston, which we\nreceived on 29/12/2020. We apologise for the significant delay in\nresponding to this request. This has been due to a substantial backlog of\nrequests due to the pandemic.\n1.A Can the council confirm if this request by Steve Eccleston was\nreflected in any document retention policy or retention schedules? If so\nplease provide the document.\nYour reference is to an email of 18 February 2020, which we released to\nyou on 13 May 2022 (our ref: Response \u2013 Internal Review \u2013 Reference \u2013 FOI\n/ 2019-20-1881 / IC-98355-J1F7). We have attached it for reference.\nA document retention policy or retention schedule would contain what\ninformation is held by the council and set out retention periods and final\ndisposition actions.[1][1] The council has a retention schedule and a\nrecords management policy. Neither references the use of the header \u201cnot\nsubject to FOI\u201d in emails or documents.\nThe retention or disposal of the emails with the header is not subject to\na retention policy of its own. Information is retained dependent on its\ncontent, subject to business need or legal or best practice requirements.\nThe email of 18 February 2020 explains why emails were identified in this\nway to provide a flag for appraisal should a request under information\nrights legislation be received.\n1.B Please produce all correspondence, memoranda, documents, reports,\nrecords, statements, notes, examinations, opinions, forms, electronic\nmail, and other documents and things that informed/communicated to\nofficers the process of marking \"potentially privileged emails\" with a\nheader related to \"not subject to foi\" or 'legal privilege applies etc'.\nat the start of the process referred to by Mr Eccleston.\nWe would like to distinguish between two sets of markings, \u2018legal\nprivilege applies, etc\u2019 on the one hand; and \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d on the\nother hand.\nThe first marking is normal and essential to any communication by council\nlawyers with council services. Whether that is in the subject heading or\nin their email signatures, it is standard practice for a lawyer to protect\ntheir client\u2019s confidentiality by reference to the legal professional\nprivilege protection provided under section 42 of the Freedom of\nInformation Act 2000 (FOI); Regulation 12(5)(b) of the Environmental\nInformation Regulations 2004 (EIR) and section 19 of Schedule 2 (Part 4)\nof the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).\nHowever, privilege \u201cbelongs\u201d to the client not the lawyers so genuinely\nprivileged material can be released. In our situation, the council is the\nclient, and privileged discussions between lawyers and clients are a safe\nspace to consider ambiguous issues confidentially. Under FOI and EIR,\nthere must be a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in retaining privilege on top of the\nprivilege itself, to avoid disclosure. The courts have set a high\nthreshold for privileged material to be disclosed. In Murray-Smith v\nInformation Commissioner ([2]EA/2021/0039V, 4 August 2021) the First Tier\nTribunal (FTT) said: \u201cA public authority will most often be entitled to\nobtain legal advice on an issue and to rely on LPP to withhold it even\nwhen a request is made under FOIA,\u00a0 because of the in-built public\ninterest established by the courts in maintaining LPP\u201d (paragraph 35).\nThe other marking of emails has been \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d. No official\nrecord of Sheffield City Council is \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d. We understand\nour statutory obligation under section 1 of the FOIA. Information may be\nwithheld under an exemption, but that is under the Act itself. It is never\n\u201cNot subject to FOI\u201d. Unfortunately, there was an elision between \u201clegal\nprivilege\u201d and \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d, which is not supported by the\nlegislation. We sincerely regret the use of this phrase for the\nmisunderstanding that it has caused.\nThe decision to mark emails \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d was not part of a policy\nprocess. It was a response to contentious litigation. Council officers\nanticipated large numbers of FOI requests. They wanted to make sure that\nprivileged material was properly identified and flagged for checking\nagainst the tests before disclosure. There was a risk that this might not\nhappen if emails were not clearly identified, given the volume of\ncorrespondence. The header text was designed to do that. But that flag did\nnot in itself determine disclosure or non-disclosure. Each bundle of\nrecords had to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if there\nwere exemptions, and then, subject them to the public interest test.\nThe reference to the \u201cstart of the process\u201d could be deemed to be 2013,\nwhich is the year agreed between the council\u2019s cabinet and street tree\ncampaigners to provide documentation for the Street Trees Archive. There\nwill be emails with the header \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d as part of that\ndisclosure (unless, separate and apart from that marking, they can be\nwithheld under FOI, EIR, or DPA).\nBut to the best of our knowledge, we hold no record \u201cfrom the start of the\nprocess\u201d which sets out how officers were informed or communicated with\nregarding the flagging of emails that may contain exempt information if\nrequested by the public.\nWe understand that the identification of emails which may be legally\nprivileged, in anticipation of FOI/EIR requests, was raised verbally\nbetween the council lawyer and the director with responsibility for the\nHighways Service at the time the council legal team received instructions\nto consider injunction proceedings relating to protests against street\ntree felling.\nWe do not have information to add to that.\nWe have responded to more than 450 requests for information about street\ntrees under FOI and EIR in the past seven years. We understand the public\ninterest in the process of response, as much as the responses themselves.\nWhere information has not been sourced by us in response to your request,\nwe hope that the Bevan Brittan report into the use of the label \u201cnot\nsubject to FOI\u201d; the publication of the Street Tree Archive and Sir Mark\nLowcock\u2019s Street Trees Inquiry will provide further avenues for the\nscrutiny of our efforts.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.

It just states\nthere was one.\n*/We sincerely regret the use of this phrase for the misunderstanding that\nit has caused. */\nThere isn't a misunderstanding, the council titled records \"NOT SUBJECT TO\nFOIA\".\u00a0 The council has made multiple statements to the press such as the\nuse of this particular header, never in these statements was it\nidentified as elision or misunderstanding, it was a deliberate process to\nenable sorting of records is the councils claim, the council still has not\nprovided any recorded information showing this was the case.\n*/The decision to mark emails \u201cnot subject to FOI\u201d was not part of a\npolicy process. It was a response to contentious litigation. Council\nofficers anticipated large numbers of FOI requests. */\nAnother statement, not recorded information.\u00a0 - This also contradictory\nstatement.\u00a0 \"It was a response to contentious litigation\" and then in\nSteves CYA email it's stated \"...I asked for emails to carry this\nheader... right at the start of this process\"\nSo which was it, was it a\u00a0 response to \"contentious litigation\" or the\nhead of legal telling people to use the header\u00a0 \"right at the start of\nthis process\".\n*/The reference to the \u201cstart of the process\u201d could be deemed to be 2013,\nwhich is the year agreed between the council\u2019s cabinet */\nAn ambiguous statement\u00a0 \"COULD BE DEEMED\" Was it or was it not. There\nwasn't any litigation in 2013, contradicting the councils response that\nthe header was used in response to \"contentious litigation\".\n*/But to the best of our knowledge, we hold no record \u201cfrom the start of\nthe\nprocess\u201d which sets out how officers were informed or communicated with\nregarding the flagging of emails that may contain exempt information if\nrequested by the public. */\nI'm gonna suggest you go back and search. It seems implausible that\nmultiple teams, from different depts, CEX, Highways, Information\nManagement and Legal, were using a process to mark and filter council\ndocuments in anticipation for FOI requests\u00a0 as asked by the head of\nlegal.\u00a0 But there is no documents about how this was implemented, or how\nmultiple different teams were informed of this process.\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nA full history of my FOI request and all correspondence is available on\nthe Internet at this address:\n[2]\nhttps://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlo...\nYours faithfully,\nMarcus Combie\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease use this email address for all replies to this request:\n[3][FOI #714520 email]\nDisclaimer: This message and any reply that you make will be published on\nthe internet.
