In fact having seen the\nneighbouring trees included within the same TPO that have been reduced in\nthe past, they could be reduced by up to 2.5 m to further improve the\ngarden whilst maintaining sensible management of the trees. T2 is located\nin the centre of the garden and has been suppressed by T1 and T3 leaving\nit with a smaller tight crown between these two larger trees. This tree\ncould be removed to promote the crowns of T1 and T3 to become more uniform\nwhilst improving the garden for the resident. The removal of this tree\nwould not have a long-term detrimental effect on the treescape as T1 and\nT3 will be improved as they have more space to grow. The lasting landscape\nfeature of the line of trees will also be retained if this one tree is\nremoved.\nWill amend permission to:\nT1 Lime. Remove lower epicormic growth and reduce in height by up to 3 m\nfrom growing tips to a suitable growth point. Reduce laterally by up to\n1.5 m from all growing tips to a suitable growth point.\nT2 Lime. Fell to ground level.\nT3 Lime. Remove lower epicormic growth and reduce in height by up to 3 m\nfrom growing tips to a suitable growth point.
