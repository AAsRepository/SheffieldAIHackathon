However, on application of the public\ninterest test, we believe that the public interest lies in favour of\ndisclosure. While we recognise that it is important to protect the concept\nof legal professional privilege and the rationale behind the concept,\nwhich is to safeguard frankness between lawyer and client, we also\nrecognise that there is a public interest in openness and transparency,\nwhich in this case, is more important than maintaining protecting the\nconcept of privilege. Therefore, we have disclosed the email.\nHowever, please note that the names of \u00a0some staff members have been\nredacted under section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on the\ngrounds that these are personal data and disclosure would contravene the\ndata protection principle under Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data\nProtection Regulation that processing of personal data must be fair,\nlawful and transparent.\n2.

It does not appear as if it were a response to provide recorded information. I have two objections to the response.\nFIRST OBJECTION\nThe requestor would be seeking in the internal review the FOI teams response here and apparently totally normal process.\u2028But in private, the FOI team seemed to be completely oblivious this action was taking place or was standard operation procedure. I refer the council to the following email.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFrom: <REDACTED> on Behalf of FOI\nSent: 06 December 2019 14:30\nTo: <REDCATED>\u2028CC:<REDACTED>\nSubject: RE FOI 116 Operation Quito\nAttachments RE: FOI 116 Internal Review 1 of 2;  FOI 116 Internal Review 2 of 2; \u2028\u2028Please see attached.\u2028\u2028Please note that although some of the emails are entitled \u201clegally privileged - not subject to FOIA\u201d there were not legally privileged and we cannot declare something not subject to FOIA.\u2028\u2028Please feel free to call me if you have any queries\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe email provided by Steve Eccleston that seems to have post hoc feeling. Mr Ecclestons email was sent 18 February 2020, after the FOI team informing <redacted> and <redacted> on 06 December 2019.\nRequest FOI 116, was a request I made, in that request the council initially told me 4 documents were held, 2 of which were forwarded press statements for SYP\u2026 I informed SCC of 7 documents missing from disclosure (That I knew of)\nThe FOI team replied that :\n\u201cI have contacted the officers involved at the time and they have confirmed they don\u2019t hold any further information on this.\u201d\nMultiple council officer who are either senders or recipients of the comms with \u2018Not subject to FOI\u2019 still work in council, eg head of highways, I imagine it\u2019s hard for \u201cOfficers in the Information Management Team review all correspondence before it is disclosed under FOI\u201d. If it has not been disclosed to them and the departments reply back \u201cthey don\u2019t hold any further information on this.\u201d It was only after I pointed out the apparent absurdity of planning a three agency meeting including the police on multiple days\u2026 and only have 4 documents to provide, most of which were after the meetings. Did more documents come to light.\n\u201cOfficers in Legal Services were instructed to mark emails as legally\nprivileged and not subject to FOI in order to flag to officers in the\nInformation Management Team\u201d this is what the council is claiming. However in RE: Release of schedule 2 (legal privilege applies exempt from FOI) 02 March 2018 06:35 this email was about an SCC press release, the prior emails in this chain were not marked \u201clegal privilege\u201d, it\u2019s only after a council officer discussed the press release they added legal privilege applies - no member of legal services was copied in and the communications was about a press release not the course case.\nSo factually the statement provided doesn't reference reality, and it conflicts with the cases referenced.\nSECOND OBJECTION:\n2. Identify and provide any recorded information where the FOI teams were\nmade aware that this consideration had taken place, and they were aware of\nthis practice.\nWhat the council provided doesn\u2019t satisfy the request, it\u2019s not recorded information. The requestor is seeking records that clearly show the FOI team were aware of this practice and consideration to mark emails \u201cNot subject to FOI\u201d. From what has been provided by Steve Eccleston he had directed people to \u201cI asked for potentially privileged emails involving lawyers to carry this header right at the start of the process\u201d. Any record from around the start of the process informing the FOI team \u201cthat this consideration had taken place,\u201d  and acknowledgement that FOI \u201cthey were aware of this practice.\u201d Would be an ideal response for recorded information.\nIt seems in the email sent from the FOI team on 06 December 2019 they were not aware of this practice, and from my reading of the email seemed pretty aghast it was happening.\n******************************\n4. Please provide from\u00a0 FS5074568 the request for information sent out\u2028from the FOI team to relevant departments and the responses received back\u2028with information held.\nhttps://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-tak...\nI don\u2019t think all the information has been provided In relation to the request, for brevity and to same time and space, the council made multiple assurances to the ICO in their investigation, and provide details. The emails provided don\u2019t contain these the FOI team sourcing these responses.\u2028\u2028I don\u2019t see any recorded information provided from the information holders.\n****************************\n5. I'm having a hard time understanding the no information held. Could the FOI team expand on this on the internal review.\nThe email reference in 5 request  matches and is held information for FS5074568\nStatement provided to 3 and 4 states \"Information Management Team review all correspondence before it is\ndisclosed under FOI\" and the statement that this request is about also claims \"The exemptions used will always be thoroughly scrutinised by the council\u2019s internal FOI team when handling these requests,\"\nIm looking for records of this thorough scrutiny applied to this record, as it was a responsive record, it matched the requestors information and matched the scope of an ICO investigation.\nYours sincerely,\nMarcus Combie"

REF  FOI 2020-21-2670\nThe council made a statement about my request:\n\"We have already provided copies of the information that we hold in\nrelation to emails with the subject \"Covered by legal privilege and not\nsubject to FOI\" and in relation to Legal Services informing officers of\nthis practice in our response to FOI 2019-20-1881\" - This statement is false. The only materials the council provided were from Paul Bilington's inbox, and only materials that matched keywords such as Quito or Trees. The information provided to my request was not all the information the council holds. To be expounding the position in other requests is false.\nThe council also states:\n\"We have already provided copies of the information that we hold in\nrelation to emails with the subject \"Covered by legal privilege and not\nsubject to FOI\" and in relation to Legal Services informing officers of\nthis practice in our response to FOI 2019-20-1881, and therefore we\nconsider that your request is an attempt to reopen a matter which has\nalready been comprehensively addressed by the local authority.\"\n- The requestor would categorically disagree with the council's positions this has been  been comprehensively addressed \". The internal review I submitted at the time and (still waiting on) explained clearly my objections to your response to FOI 2019-20-188\nThe internal review has not been complete.\nTwo complaints have been submitted.\nOne I was told by Kate Josephs on 18th March that  David Hollis, the Deputy Monitoring Officer will be leading the standards complaint against members and Eugene Walker, Executive Director Resources, will lead on the complaint against officers. Regarding the matter of marking emails \"not subject to FOI\" while an independent person is to look at the factual background.\nI'm making this public so R Naylor can have visibility of my thoughts on this matter, I wish I had saw his request before so. could have posted this.\nFurthermore, I'm chasing this internal review again. Please indicate to the requestor when it will be produced or my options for remedy.\nYours sincerely\nMarcus Combie"
