Whilst it concluded \u2018that racism and racial\ndisparities remain significant in the lives of Sheffield citizens\u2019, no\nindividual organisations where specifically cited as being racist. Rather,\nall partner organisations in the city were asked to be reflective and\nassess where themselves against the REC\u2019s recommendations and actions and\naim to be organisations where equality, diversity and inclusion becomes\n\u2018business as usual\u2019. Following the publication of the Commission\u2019s\nindependent report, the Council published its initial response to the\nreport of the Commission in August 2022 and a more detailed in response in\nDecember 2022, which can both be found on our website here: [1]Our\ncommitment to equality | Sheffield City Council.\u00a0 In December 2023 a\nfollow-up report was produced setting out how the council intended to move\nquickly to become an anti-racist organisation.\u00a0 This is also available on\nthe webpage above. \u00a0The Council did not conclude in any of these reports\nthat it was systematically racist, but acknowledged that we have further\nto go to root out racism, inequality and discrimination in its three roles\nof city leadership, service delivery, and employer.\nQuestion 2\n(a) Is there a legal requirement for Sheffield Council to be an\n\u201canti-racist\u201d organisation?

The details can\nbe found on pg. 97 in the main report and pg. 7/8 of the summary [3]Race\nEquality Commission | Sheffield City Council.\nQuestion 3\na.\u00a0Does Sheffield Council believe that the Racial Equality report is in\nanyway, shape or form influenced by the contested political idea of\nCritical Race Theory ? (i) Please answer : Yes, No or Don\u2019t Know and\n(ii) if the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019 please provide some brief explanation,\nexamples of how, where(e.g page, paragraph number) the report is\ninfluenced by Critical Race Theory\nNo information held \u2013 the Commission was independent of the City Council.\n(b) Does Sheffield City Council in anyway require it\u2019s employees to\nbelieve in or adhere to or be compliant with Critical Race Theory ?\nNo\n(c) Under UK law, Sheffield Council is required to be an independent,\nimpartial organisation with political restrictions e.g on senior officers.\nWould the adoption of\u00a0 the contested political ideology of Critical Race\nTheory in anyway be compatible with Sheffield Council\u2019s Legal requirements\nto be independent and impartial and for its Officers to be the same?\nNo information held.\nAs noted above the Council works to statutory obligations set out in the\nEquality Act 2010 and, in particular, the Public Sector Equality Duty, and\nexpects all employees to adhere to this.\u00a0 Critical Race Theory is not part\nof the Equality Act.\nQuestion 4\nAs per the Racial Equality report\n(a) How does Sheffield Council define the term \u2018Equity\u2019 ?\n(b) What is the source of the definition of \u2018Equity\u2019 that Sheffield\nCouncil has used?\n(c) Is Equity a legal requirement under UK law ?\n(d) How is Equity different to (i) Equality of Opportunity?\n(e) How is Equity different to (ii) Equality of\u00a0 Outcome ?\n(f) Is the term \u2018Equity\u2019 in anyway related to Critical Race Theory ideas,\nideology etc.Please answer : Yes, No or Don\u2019t\u00a0 Know?\nThe Council does not define equity.\u00a0 We publish and have recently updated\nits Equality Objectives and an Equalities Framework which can be found on\nour website.\u00a0 We hold no other information on the concept of equity.\n[4]Our commitment to equality | Sheffield City Council\nQuestion 5\nPage 98: \u2018Operates an EDI policy with specific intersectional joined up\nrace content\u201d\n(a) is there a legal requirement for Sheffield Council to use an\n\u201cintersectional\u201d approach for EDI policies? Please answer : Yes, No or\nDon\u2019t Know.\nThe legal framework that Sheffield City Council operates within is set out\nabove.\u00a0 Whilst the concept of intersectionality is not defined within that\nframework, meeting our public sector equality duty across all protected\ncharacteristics necessitates a joined-up approach, and as such the concept\nof intersectionality can be helpful in enabling us to understand where\npeople may face specific barriers.\u00a0 This is noted in our Equality\nObjectives 2024-28.\n(b) If \u201cintersectional\u201d is not a legal requirement then please confirm\nwhether it is a contested political idea ?
