Were the Council to look to collate such information from\nreview of individual invoices received during the period of your request\nthis would take in excess of the cost threshold for dealing with FOI\nrequests. In this case to locate, retrieve and extract the requested\ninformation would likely well exceed the cost limit for dealing with FOI\nrequests under [1]Section 12 of the Freedom of Information Act. For ease\nof reference, the cost limit (18 hours or \u00a3450) is specified in the\n[2]Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees)\nRegulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed.\u00a0 You can ask for an\ninternal review by either writing to the above address or by emailing\n[3][Sheffield City Council request email].\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you\ncan contact the Information Commissioners Office.
