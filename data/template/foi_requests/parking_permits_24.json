The reference number for\nyour request can be found above.\nBefore we can begin to process your FOI Request, we would like to clarify\nwhat information you require.\nYou have asked: \u201cCould you provide data on how many requests since 20mph\nschemes have rolled out across the City of Sheffield have been around cars\nspeeding in 20mph areas.\u201d\nPlease can you provide details on what data you are after with a greater\ndegree of precision. These are our challenges:\nWe would need to know that a particular road or area was a 20mph area /\nzone when the \u2018request\u2019 was made. Not all \u2018requests\u2019 refer to the\nexistence of a 20mph area. We could search for 20mph area in emails but\nthis would also bring up areas where ones were planned and roads where\nthey are not planned because they are an \u2018A\u2019 road.\nSpeeding enforcement or expressing concern about speeding? If search\nemails for speeding concerns it may be really lengthy as there are lots of\nwords used e.g. \u2018flying past\u2019, \u2018racing\u2019, \u2018racetrack\u2019, \u2018driving\ndangerously\u2019.
