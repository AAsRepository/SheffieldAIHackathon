                "Dear FOI,\nNew response to your FOI request - How many complaints have been made about the state of roads in Chapeltown in the last 18 months\nGood afternoon,\nThank you for the response which I reviewed yesterday.  Apologies for the delay in reading this, I was travelling all day yesterday.\nI am rather gobsmacked by the data provided and would like to bounce this back to the responder for clarification as this does not really sit with the physical evidence on the road.\nTake Station Road - in 548 days, there are 249 complaints made, averaging one complaint ever 2.2 days.  The figures also state that the average time for resolution is 0.2 days , or roughly 5 hours!  If issues are resolved within 5 hours (on average) it beggars the question, why would there be 249 of them, with an average gap of 2.2 days.  In reality, these issues were hardly ever attended to, and never swiftly, with the exception of marking them as a \"clear and present danger to life\", only then did we get anything done - eventually!\nSo the main tenant of my query as to the validity of these statistics is the question I and several other locals with whom I have been working to get something done about this area's road is as follows.  What are the criteria being used to facilitate and average resolution time of 0.2 days or roughly 5 hours??  I this opening the complaint and marking it as read?  Making a site visit to assess the complaint made and making a risk assessment for adequate corrective measures to be applied as quickly as possible?  Or is it making a full and proper risk assessment and works carried out and completed?\nMany locals have been dismayed for over a year at the lack of attention to repairs on this main road A6135.  So with seeing 249 complaints and next to no action during this time, I require them to pass on these criteria.\nFinally, I also need to be made aware of who is responsible for signing off on either why works do not get actioned, or in the case of repairs, who signs off on the quality of these works - is it the workers themselves (that's OK, that'll do), an Amey supervisor, or a member of the council's own staff whose role it is to supervise and quality control these works?\nI very much look forward to seeing a response within 28 days.\nThank you very much indeed for your assistance and attention.\nYours sincerely,\nLen Sims"

                "Dear FOI,\nI appreciate the response, however, much of this is word soup and does not try to answer the questions as asked.\n1. -  I appreciate that multiple complains/comments may be made about a single defect on a road.  I still fail to see how the average resolution time on the A6135 - Station Road, in Chapeltown can be 0.2 days, whilst other figures given in the original request were in the several days.\n2 - I cannot believe that there is no required length of life for a capital investment scheme such as a road surface, if there is not that is poor a poor contract for the general public. I take the point that wear rates vary as you correctly state, but the MUST be some level of minimum life span.  Whether this be 1 week, a year, 6 years, a decade etc.   As a contractor, Amey has two masters to serve, the organsiation issuing the contract, ultimately SSC and it's own shareholders.  How sort a leash are the contractors kept on by SSC?\n3 - I have been informed after a direct complaint to Amey, that the roundabout in the centre of Chapeltown has been earmarked for 'maintenance' .  The surface is frankly a disgrace and has not been fit for purpose for more than 3 years now.  A large circular gouge opened up at the seam between two strips of the tarmac which I complained about for about a year before it was filled.  Resembling a tram line in width, it was causing accidents.  Its was eventually filled.  Now, that infill if the best part of the surface.  I know of at least one lady who was brought off her bike by a new hole that opened up over two. months ago.  The rest of the surface is la cart track.

Please do not hesitate to contact us at the email\naddress below if you have any queries.\nYours sincerely,\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [1][Sheffield City Council request email]\nFrom: Len Sims <[FOI #1115041 email]>\nSent: Tuesday, June 25, 2024 9:08 AM\nTo: FOI <[Sheffield City Council request email]>\nSubject: Internal review of Freedom of Information request - How many\ncomplaints have been made about the state of roads in Chapeltown in the\nlast 18 months\nDear FOI,\nI appreciate the response, however, much of this is word soup and does not\ntry to answer the questions as asked.\n1. -\u00a0 I appreciate that multiple complains/comments may be made about a\nsingle defect on a road.\u00a0 I still fail to see how the average resolution\ntime on the A6135 - Station Road, in Chapeltown can be 0.2 days, whilst\nother figures given in the original request were in the several days.\n2 - I cannot believe that there is no required length of life for a\ncapital investment scheme such as a road surface, if there is not that is\npoor a poor contract for the general public. I take the point that wear\nrates vary as you correctly state, but the MUST be some level of minimum\nlife span.\u00a0 Whether this be 1 week, a year, 6 years, a decade etc.\u00a0\u00a0 As a\ncontractor, Amey has two masters to serve, the organsiation issuing the\ncontract, ultimately SSC and it's own shareholders.\u00a0 How sort a leash are\nthe contractors kept on by SSC?\n3 - I have been informed after a direct complaint to Amey, that the\nroundabout in the centre of Chapeltown has been earmarked for\n'maintenance' .\u00a0 The surface is frankly a disgrace and has not been fit\nfor purpose for more than 3 years now.\u00a0 A large circular gouge opened up\nat the seam between two strips of the tarmac which I complained about for\nabout a year before it was filled.\u00a0 Resembling a tram line in width, it\nwas causing accidents.\u00a0 Its was eventually filled.\u00a0 Now, that infill if\nthe best part of the surface.\u00a0 I know of at least one lady who was brought\noff her bike by a new hole that opened up over two. months ago.\u00a0 The rest\nof the surface is la cart track.\u00a0 One of the operations executives, Mr\nLawrence, sent this\n\"Having liaised with Michelle, I can confirm that the roundabouts in\nChapeltown have been included in the schedule for resurfacing before March\n2025, although we do expect this to be completed this calendar year,\nhowever, our contractual requirement allows us up to March 2025 to\ncomplete these works.\"\nJust how dangerous does an A road need to be before urgent action is\ntaken.\nI would appreciate\u00a0 answers to these queries please.\nYours sincerely,\nLen Sims\nshow quoted sections"
