                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nQ1. \tWe are looking to find out if the council has done either of the models below for   housing.\n\u2022\tSale and Leaseback \u2013 Leaseback, short for \"sale-and-leaseback\", is a financial transaction in which one sells an asset and leases it back for the long term; therefore, one continues to be able to use the asset but no longer owns it.\n\u2022\tIncome Strip \u2013 At its simplest, an income strip investment combines a strong tenant covenant, with a long-term lease and a forward funding arrangement to give an investor a stable and secure income stream. The strong tenant covenant frequently comes from the public sector such as local councils, and the long-term lease often runs between 30 and 50 years.\nQ2.      Can you advise of weekly rents paid for the following?\n1.\tTemporary accommodation for homeless relief\n2.\tExtra care housing (not including any service charge elements, just the core rent)\n3.\tHousing / Beds for adults with complex needs\nQ3. \tDoes the council own any land or disused buildings that they would be prepared to sell and or re purpose?\nYours faithfully,\nDebbie Connal"
