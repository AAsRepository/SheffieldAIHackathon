In your response you have explained that the redactions relate to S40 and GDPR.\nS40 of the Act does not prohibit the provision of personal data. S40 calls for a balance to be struck between data protection principles and the need for transparency.\nI believe that the request is lawful, fair and transparent. There would be no point in having a licensing regime in place if nobody can identify who the licence holders are.\nThe purpose of the request is to identify licence holders, the number of breeding dogs kept by each licence holder, the star rating of each licence holder and any special conditions that attach to each licence. I believe there is a legitimate interest in collecting this data.\nIn the event that the licence holder trades from a residential address I agree that it would be appropriate to redact the address on the licence. I also agree that it is appropriate to redact the signature and the name of any council employee identified on the licence.\nI look forward to hearing from you\nYours faithfully,\nMartina"

Please accept our apologies for the lengthy delay in responding to\nyour request, and for any inconvenience this may have caused you. We have\nbeen dealing with a backlog of Internal Reviews, and also had to\nreprioritise some of our work to focus on the ongoing coronavirus\npandemic, which has led to a shortage of resources.\nI have carried out an Internal Review of the handling of your request.\nThe intention of an internal review is to consider if we handled your\nresponse in accordance with the law and to consider if any decisions made,\nfor example to refuse information, were correct and still apply.\nYou were concerned that:\nThe copy dog breeding licences provided have been redacted to such an\nextent that it is not possible to identify the licence holder. In your\nresponse you have explained that the redactions relate to S40 and GDPR.\nS40 of the Act does not prohibit the provision of personal data. S40 calls\nfor a balance to be struck between data protection principles and the need\nfor transparency.\nI believe that the request is lawful, fair and transparent. There would be\nno point in having a licensing regime in place if nobody can identify who\nthe licence holders are.\nThe purpose of the request is to identify licence holders, the number of\nbreeding dogs kept by each licence holder, the star rating of each licence\nholder and any special conditions that attach to each licence. I believe\nthere is a legitimate interest in collecting this data.\nIn the event that the licence holder trades from a residential address I\nagree that it would be appropriate to redact the address on the licence. I\nalso agree that it is appropriate to redact the signature and the name of\nany council employee identified on the licence.\nI uphold your argument that the documents have been over-redacted. At the\ntime of response, it was not clear to the FOI team if the copies of the\nlicense or specific elements of the licenses were within the public\ndomain. Due to previous concerns from dog breeders relating to the\nvulnerability of theft in the disclosure of their personal information, it\nwas decided at the time to redact the names and residential addresses of\nthe dog breeders. Upon reflection, I agree that the name of the dog\nbreeders should not have been redacted. This is further asserted through\nthe publication of the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Register via the\nLicensing website here: [1]Public Client Search - Breeding and Sale of\nDogs (sheffield.gov.uk). Residential addresses will still be redacted for\nthe protection of the dog breeders\u2019 personal safety.\nI have supplied freshly redacted copies of the licenses requested at the\ntime of the FOI request. You will note that some names are still redacted,\nnames of historic dog breeders are exempt under Section 40(2) of the\nFreedom of Information Act (Personal Data) as to release these names would\nnow be in breach of the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection\nRegulations.\nI apologise that the documentation was previously over-redacted. Thank you\nfor the opportunity to allow us to revise our redaction practices which is\noften a continuous learning process.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you are\nentitled to contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and they will\nconsider whether your complaint is eligible for further review.
