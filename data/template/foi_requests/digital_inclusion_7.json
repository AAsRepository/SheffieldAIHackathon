                "Dear Matthew Smith,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Digital inclusion\nwhich we received on 09/03/2021.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1.\u00a0DI is measured or reported on by each year by ONS, OfCom, Lloyds Bank\nand Good Things Foundation. SCC considers all of these measures in its\nassessment of digital inclusion. SCC has established a DI Taskforce,\nfollowing a city wide DI summit in Jan 2021. The taskforce met for the\nfirst time in Feb 2021 and is defining a vision, aims and objectives\nthat it will consult on in due course. These will be published on the\ncouncils website and we recommended checking the SCC website over the\ncoming weeks for further information.\n2.\u00a0SCC\u2019s contract with Heeley Trust is for delivery of approximately 20\nfree online classes per week, delivered at libraries and community\ncentres across the city.\u00a0 They are specifically promoted to our\ntenants and leaseholders as they are funded by the Housing Revenue\naccount (HRA). The classes are delivered by a network of volunteer\nDigital Champions, and they follow the \u2018Learn My Way\u2019 course (a\nnational digital learning app / platform). Since the first lockdown,\nHT have had to change their approach.\u00a0 They now deliver a range of\nonline support sessions to replace the in-person classes.\u00a0 These\ninclude a weekly Digital Inclusion class via Zoom, weekly \u2018iTea &\nChats\u2019, weekly classes focusing specifically on using iPads and ad hoc\n\u2018PC Doctor\u2019 sessions.\u00a0 Heeley are also providing 1:1 telephone support\nto tenants. Alongside the routine classes, HT also work with us to\ntrain a number of our TARA reps to be the \u2018digital champion\u2019 for their\narea, and those DCs get ongoing support from both us and HT.\n3.\u00a0SCC is currently investigating if/how it can break down DI data at a\nmore granular level and is in discussion with partner organsiations\nabout how this might be done. SCC also expects to consult with local\ngroups supporting DI to see if they can help contribute to this hyper\nlocal understanding empirically and/or qualitatively. There are other\nindicators which can also be used to estimate the levels of DI such as\ndeprivation indices.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
