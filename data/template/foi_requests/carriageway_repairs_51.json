                "Dear Steven Thomas\nThank you for your request for information relating to carriageway repairs\nwhich we received on 07/04/2025.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nQuestion 1\nDo you use internal or external contractors to facilitate the following\npothole repairs, patching works, pre patching and small scale resurfacing\nprojects\nSheffield City Council has a Private Finance Initiative contract with Amey\nHallam Highways Ltd for the delivery of a complete highway maintenance\nservice which includes all highway maintenance activities such as street\nlighting, street cleaning, carriageway and footway resurfacing, signal\nmaintenance, etc.\u00a0 Amey currently uses both its own internal teams and\nexternal contractors.\nQuestion 2\nWhat machinery do you use for pothole repairs, patching works, pre\npatching and small scale resurfacing works\nAmey uses the following machinery:\nWhacker plate\nJCB\nRoller\nStihl Saw\nBreaker\nCat and Genny\nQuestion 3\nHow much do you spend per pothole repair on average via traditional\nmethods and machinery repairs\nSheffield City Council has a Private Finance Initiative contract with Amey\nHallam Highways Ltd for the delivery of a complete highway maintenance\nservice which includes all highway maintenance activities such as street\nlighting, street cleaning, carriageway and footway resurfacing, signal\nmaintenance, etc.\u00a0 Payments made by the Council under the contract do not\nrelate to the provision of specific items of work.\u00a0 Instead, a single\npayment is made for each month of the 25-year term of the contract.\u00a0 As a\nresult, we do not have a figure for the costs incurred by Amey for\nindividual operations such as pothole repair.\nQuestion 4\nHow much does it cost you to repair each identified pothole on average?\nSee answer to Question 3.\nQuestion 5\nAre you in contact with a company for pothole/patching/pre-pathing\nrepairs? if so, who is this contractor with\nAmey is currently responsible for all highway maintenance activities.\nSubcontractors are used to support with specialist maintenance activities\nwhere required.\u00a0We are withholding the name of the sub-contractor.\nRegulation 12(5)(e) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004\n(EIR) provides an exception for the confidentiality of commercial\ninformation where such confidentiality is provided by law to protect a\nlegitimate economic interest.\n(1) The information is commercial because Amey Hallam Highways Ltd is\ntrading company operating for profit.\n(2) The information is subject to confidentiality provided by law. There\nis a duty of confidence that the council owes its contractors.\n(3) The legitimate economic interests of Amey are maintaining their\ncompetitiveness in an open market. We want to avoid publishing information\nwhich would likely prejudice their ability to compete for other contracts.\n(4) Confidentiality would be adversely affected by disclosure because it\nis subject to confidentiality provided by law and that confidentiality was\nprovided to protect a legitimate economic interest.\nRegulation 12(5)(e) is subject to the public interest test set out at\nregulation 12(1)(b). Therefore, the Council must consider whether, in all\nthe circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the\nexception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the withheld\ninformation.\nFurthermore, regulation 12(2) of the EIR requires a public authority to\napply a presumption in favour of disclosure when relying on any of the\nregulation 12 exceptions.\nThe public interest in disclosure is transparency and accountability.\nThe public interest withholding the information is the harm to the\ncommercial interests of Amey Hallam Highways Ltd, which will be\ndisadvantaged compared to its competitors.\nThe public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public\ninterest in disclosure. This is because, the withheld information retains\na commercial sensitivity, and it would not be in the public interest for\ninformation to be disclosed which would prejudice the Council\u2019s efforts to\nmaintain proper relationships with its contractors.\nIn reaching this decision we have relied upon the guidance from the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).
