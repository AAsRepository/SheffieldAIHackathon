                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nPlease could you provide more information on the newly installed speed camera on Shepcote Lane near the railway bridge. Specifically, whether the camera measures speed in both directions or just northbound towards Meadowhall. If you're also able to confirm whether this monitors mobile phone usage and/or seatbelts that would also be appreciated.\nYours faithfully,\nRichard Hoyland"
