                "Dear Daley Schofield\nThank you for your request for information relating to DSAR Numbers\nreceived and extended. which we received on 21/02/2024.\nI would be grateful to understand how many Data Subject Access Requests\nyou have received from 01 January 2022 to date\nSheffield City Council has received 2069 Subject Access Requests since 01\nJanuary 2022.\nHow many had the timeframe extended due to being deemed \u2018complex\u2019\nThe number of Subject Requests that have been deemed \u2018complex\u2019 is exempt\nfrom disclosure under 12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Sheffield\nCity Council does hold this information, but it is not recorded in a\nformat that allows us to produce an electronic report. Instead, we would\nneed to check each case file to see if it contained an extension letter.\nWe have received 2069 Subject Access Requests since 01 January 2022, and\nwe estimate that it would take at least two minutes to check each case\nfile. This would take 4138 minutes, or almost 69 hours, to collate the\ninformation, which is more than the cost limit of 18 hours or \u00a3450\nspecified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data Protection\n(Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. If you would like to narrow\ndown the focus of your request, we would be happy to process your revised\nrequest as a new request for information under the Freedom of Information\nAct 2000.\nHow many were refused as \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019.\nWe have refused 5 Subject Access Requests since 01 January 2022 on the\ngrounds that they were \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
