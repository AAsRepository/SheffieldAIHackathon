                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nBetween January 2015 and January 2017, Cycle Sheffield recorded over 380 crashes involving cyclists on tram tracks. As of today's date, there are 841 recorded crashes: an average of 7 recorded crashes per month between January 2015 and May 2024 (\nhttps://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/2017/0...\n)\nIn December 2016 Sheffield City Council approved a Tram / Cycle Safety Action Plan.\nThis plan contained five specific action points, which I have listed below. I have numbered the list for ease of reference. I have followed each one with my questions:\n1 - \"By March 2017 design solutions at the top five worst accident sites\"\na) Please provide a list of the top five worst accident sites.\nb) Please provide copies of the agreed design solutions for these sites.\n2 - \"By June 2017 design solutions for the remaining top 20 sites. Agree a schedule of work for these solutions to be implemented in financial years 2017/18 and 2018/19\"\na) Please provide a list of the remaining 15 sites.\nb) Please provide copies of the agreed design solutions for these sites.\nc) Please provide a copy of the agreed schedule for those solutions to be implemented.\n3  - \"Complete implementation of the top 5 sites by September 2017\"\na) Please provide the actual dates when the these were implemented.\n4 - \"Develop in 2016/17 and pilot 2017/18 a cyclist/ tram-track solution for each type of tram/ carriageway interface (e.g. tram stops, tram track leaves road to left, to right etc.). Develop a plan for the deployment of these solutions and an on-going programme of works and ensure that these solutions are incorporated in all future Supertram infrastructure schemes.\"\na) Please provide a list of the types of tram/carriageway interface that were considered.\nb) Please provide details of the sites where solutions were piloted.\nc) Please provide the dates when these solutions were piloted.\nd) Please provide copies of the evaluation of the pilot solutions.\ne) Please provide a copy of the plan for the deployment of these solutions.\n5 -\" During financial years 2017/ 18 and 2018/ 19 implement solutions for the top 20 accident sites.\"\na) Please provide the actual dates when these were implemented.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, please note that the erection of warning notices stating \"Tram Tracks - Wheels may slip or catch\" was listed as an immediate interim measure prior to the implementation of more permanent solutions, and do not form part of any of the action points listed above.\nYours faithfully,\nRebecca Hammond"

More information about the SYMCA can be found here [1]South\nYorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority - South Yorkshire MCA\n(southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk)\u00a0 We can only build what we have bid for using\nthis funding avenue (we cannot divert funding onto other projects). The\nDfT set the criteria for said bids and for the last 5 or 6 years if not\nmore that criteria has focussed on boosting the economy \u2013 creating better\noptions for travel to reduce traffic and thus open up development sites.\nIn addition, providing better travel options enables the population to\ntravel to locations that may only be currently accessible by car.\nIn general, our approach has been to focus on improving parallel routes,\nsuch as the University - Leavygreave - Portobello route which is now a\nhigh-quality alternative route to West Street, rather than trying to make\nchanges on the sections of tram route, this means that we are avoiding the\nrisk more fully by passing Tram hotspots. We have ATF funding to review\nthe route from the city along Penistone Road which is parallel to Langsett\nRoad and improvements between City Centre \u2013 Kelham are currently being\ndelivered as part of the route.\nWe do however through what was known as the Local Transport Plan have a\ndiscretionary budget, and a percentage of that is allocated to Road Safety\nand that allocation is earmarked for those locations that are the worst\nranked for road safety.\nWe do wait on the results of the Ghent study (into infilling of tracks).\nThis may not prevent slipping but may prevent wheels getting stuck\n[2]Cyclists get safer tram tracks in Ghent - Cities Today\n(cities-today.com)\n1 - \"By March 2017 design solutions at the top five worst accident sites\"\na.\u00a0Please provide a list of the top five worst accident sites.\nRank Location\n1 Langsett Road at Primrose Hill tram stop.\n2 Holme Lane / Loxley New Road / Ball Road junction.\n3 White Lane at White Lane tram stop.\n4 Glossop Road at junction with Upper Hannover St.\n5 Hillsborough corner.\nb) Please provide copies of the agreed design solutions for these sites. \u2013\nNo design solutions were agreed for any of these sites.\n2 - \"By June 2017 design solutions for the remaining top 20 sites.
