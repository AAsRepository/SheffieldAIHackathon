While the Inquiry found that the outcomes of legal action would have been the same without the Council's version of the 5-year tree management strategy, this document was misleading and mishandled. The Council should have removed it from circulation and made the Courts aware that it was not part of Amey's operational approach. Misleading the Courts is a serious matter and we will write to them to apologise.\u201d\nI\u2019ve have been waiting for a response for Paul Brook FOI, as I have been interested in this apology. Paul\u2019s FOI is past its statutory response time. And I would like to understand why.\n\u2014-\nThis requestor is seeking to understand what searches for records were undertaken when responding to this request, and how the council requested recorded information from record custodians. In addition to, how the council handled this request.\nRecorded information relevant to this request will include, but not be limited to: communication from the FOI team to the relevant parties who held requested information and records sought. The responses in-turn received. \u2028\u2028Any discussion how to respond to this request.\nYours faithfully,\nMc"
