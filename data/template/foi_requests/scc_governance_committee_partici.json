                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nIn the first week of September (2024) SCC held a Participation Workshop.  This was part of the work the Governance Committee is undertaking to improve citizen/community/stakeholder participation in the council, and following commissioned work and a report undertaken by the national organisation \u2018Involve\u2019.\nMy request has three parts\nFirstly, I would like:\n- a list of all those who attended the workshop and the groups/organisations or institutions they are affiliated with.\nI recognise that this request will include the \u2018data\u2019 (names etc) of third parties (external to the council).  However, this was a workshop on Participation and it would be very strange (and full of irony) if the council attempted not to seek the permission of those who attended to be able to indicate this attendance. (Those who I already know who attended would not object to disclosure in any way.)  This permission should, of course, have been sought at the outset of the Participation Workshop, but it appears it was not.  So I am aware my request will involve the council, in retrospect, seeking permission from those who attended, to disclose their participation at the workshop.\nSecondly, I would like:\n- a copy of the invitation letter that went out to participants at the workshop (which can, of course, be anonymised).  It may be that there are several different \u2018invitation letters\u2019 depending on who, or which sub-group, participants occupied e.g. officers, members, academics, VCS participants.  In this case, I would like a copy of each of the different invitations that went out.\nThirdly, I would like:\n- any and all information and material available (including, but not limited to, email correspondence, notes or minutes of any meetings, WhatsApp messages, written records of phone calls or conversations) pertaining to the criteria for selection/attendance of participants, and related to all planning for the workshop.  As a steer, this is certainly likely to include correspondence between council officers, Cllr Fran Belbin (Chair of the Governance Committee) and Helen Steers (or Helen Sims) at Voluntary Action Sheffield (VAS) (who were asked to help organise/lead the meeting).  Again, it is possible that these materials mention named third parties of Workshop attendees and, for the purposes of this request, I would expect that permission be sought to disclose this third party data (rather than simply redact that information in any materials available).  Approaches to participation are central to a council\u2019s work and openness and transparency about this is, of course, vital.\nThank you very much\nYours faithfully,\nRuth Hubbard"

                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nThank you for supplying some information.  I note that you have not requested data release from actual participants selected for the Participation Workshop. This basic lack of transparency and behind closed doors discussion is obviously not a hopeful sign for SCC's claimed aim of \"transforming\" its relationship with citizens and communities.\nHowever I am more concerned with the partial nature of the information relating to question 3.  You have not included my exchanges of emails requesting ian nvitation  - the point is not for me to see these (obviously i know they exist) but to bring information into the public domain.  Nor have you included at least one other request for an invitation, plus response,  that came from someone else around the time of my requests (and that I have also seen) so this needs to be included, with response.  I expect there is a full suite of responses to the invitation that are not included.  Whilst I understand you will redact individual names based on your approach above, the replies (and any other exchanges with third parties about attendance)  do need to be included in responding to the FOI properly.  Please can you provide the missing information.\nYours faithfully,\nRuth Hubbard"
