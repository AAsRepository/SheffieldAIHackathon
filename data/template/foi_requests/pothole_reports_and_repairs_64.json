                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI am requesting information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 regarding potholes in the council area. I understand different councils may define potholes and repairs differently, so I would appreciate clarification if your council applies a specific threshold for logging or repairing potholes.\nI would like to request the following data for the past five calendar years (2020\u20132024):\n1. The number of potholes recorded each year, including potholes reported by the public and confirmed through council inspections (if these are reported differently)\n2. The number of individual potholes repaired each year, including temporary repairs (e.g., patching) and permanent repairs (e.g., resurfacing). Note this refers to the number of individual potholes that were repaired, not the total number of repairs.\n3. The total annual cost of pothole repairs, if available.\nIf the data is recorded differently, I would appreciate any comparable figures you can provide, along with a brief explanation of how pothole reports and repairs are logged in your system.\nIf this request exceeds the cost limit under the FOI Act, please let me know how it may be refined to remain within the statutory limits.\nThank you for your help; please let me know if you require any clarification or have any questions.\nAll the best,\nJamie Dixon"

There may be some\nduplication where the same defect has been reported multiple times.\nThe figures contain reports which have been classed as \u2018permanently\nresolved\u2019.\u00a0 They also include reports which are not classed as\n\u2018permanently resolved\u2019 due to them, for example, being below the threshold\nfor intervention, could not be located or not on the highway network\nmaintainable under the Highway Maintenance Contract with Amey Hallam\nHighways Ltd.\nPlease note that while we do hold this information, we are refusing your\nrequest under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the Environmental Information\nRegulations 2004 on the grounds that it would be manifestly unreasonable\nto comply with the request. We do not record this information in a format\nthat allows us to produce an electronic report of this and therefore, we\nwould have to carry out a manual search of each record. The figures above\nrelate to the number of reports (Enquiries and Defects) relating to\npotholes and it is possible for one report to include more than one\npothole.\u00a0The number of individual potholes is not in a readily searchable\nformat. \u00a0To calculate the number of individual potholes, each pothole\nreport would have to be manually checked.\u00a0 It is estimated that checking\nwould take approximately two minutes per report (which would include\nchecking linked jobs, photos, different location descriptions, etc) which\nwould total approximately 1,695 hours.\nRegulation 12(4)(b) is subject to a public interest test. Factors in\nfavour of disclosure are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency. Factors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it\nis not in the public interest to spend such a large amount of officer time\non providing this information, as this would come at a large cost to the\ncouncil and would divert officers from being able to carry out other work.\nOn balance, the council believes that the public interest lies in\nmaintaining the exception.\n2.\u00a0The number of individual potholes repaired each year, including\ntemporary repairs (e.g., patching) and permanent repairs (e.g.,\nresurfacing).
