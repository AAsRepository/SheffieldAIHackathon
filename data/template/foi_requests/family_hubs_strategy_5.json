This strategic communication approach is\ndeeply embedded within our broader Early Help strategy.\n\u2022\u00a0Virtual offer: enhancing the virtual offerings of key Start for Life\nservices to meet and exceed expectations, ensuring accessibility for\nfamilies. Concurrently, we are committed to nurturing the growth of a\nFamily Hub Network.\n\u2022\u00a0Oral Health: Recognising the pressing need, we have also allocated\nresources towards improving Oral Health outcomes. Statistics reveal a\nhigher prevalence and severity of tooth decay among 5-year-olds\ncompared to regional and national averages. In the 20% most deprived\nareas of our city, 60% of children are affected (Source: PHE, 2019,\nChild and Maternal Health - Oral health).\n\u2022\u00a0Nutrition & Weight Management support: This will enable the creation\nof a dedicated position to work closely with the Health Visiting\nService, providing tailored assistance to families with children\nidentified as at-risk of obesity during the 2-year health visitor\nassessment, on a one-to-one basis.\n\u2022\u00a0Outdoor Play: Lastly, we are excited to unveil plans for the\ndevelopment of outdoor play facilities at select Family Hubs, catering\nto children of all age groups. Concurrently, investment in staff\ntraining will empower them to become qualified instructors, capable of\nextending their expertise to numerous other organizations interested\nin outdoor play. This endeavour aims to expand our offerings for older\nchildren, foster deeper connections with youth and SEND services, and\nfurther promote integration with service providers in the VCF sector.\n2.\u00a0Has a digital solution already been procured? If so, who is the\nproviding the platform?\nSheffield City Council has acquired a digital solution from PPL to\nfacilitate the delivery of the Sheffield Directory.
