                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act, I would like to request the following information.\nI would like to receive the contamination rates for household waste processed by the council/local authority from April 2023 until the most recent available data update.\nPrimarily this should include how much household waste is taken for recycling purposes and then how much of this waste is in fact recycled.\nThis should also include how much household waste is sent for incineration and/or landfill.\nIf possible, I would like to receive this data in a CSV format, with clear date timelines.\nIf it is not possible to provide the information requested due to the information exceeding the cost of compliance limits identified in Section 12, please provide advice and assistance, under the Section 16 obligations of the Act, as to how I can refine my request.\nIf you have any queries please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me via email or phone and I will be very happy to clarify what I am asking for and discuss the request, my details are outlined below.\nThank you for your time and I look forward to your response.\nYours faithfully,\nDarren Boyle"
