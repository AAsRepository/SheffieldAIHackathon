We uphold your complaint which was about our\nfailure to respond within the legal deadline to your original request for\ninformation. You made your request on 12 September 2023, and it was due on\n10 October 2023. You requested an internal review on 8 December 2023.\nWe have breached section 10(1) of the Act by failing to respond to a\nrequest for information promptly and within 20 working days following the\ndate of receipt of the request. We have also fallen short of the Freedom\nof Information Code of Practice under Section 45 which expects internal\nreviews to be provided within 20 working days of receipt. We are a small\nteam, with a large volume of requests.\nWe initially misread your request and looked for all correspondence with\nthe Charity Commission. We identified 2,659 items (2.06GB) for the period\n1 January 2005 until 12 September 2023. You specified correspondence from\nthe Charity Commission. We have since retrieved 631 emails. However, this\nfigure is not complete because it does not cover a previous email address\nthe CC used during this period.\nSeveral services across the council would be in scope. Correspondence from\nthe Charity Commission is not held in a single paper or electronic file.\nOur files contain our dealings with the CC amongst all the other work we\nhave done relating to a particular park or entity. We don\u2019t open separate\nfiles simply to deal with correspondence with the CC.\nIn Legal Services, we have a project currently to identify all of SCC\u2019s\ncharity holdings. All the deeds for the land in Parks are being studied\nand charitable documents logged. This work has so far taken 26 hours 18\nminutes.\nIn Property Services, we have 40,000 records. Charity Commission\ncorrespondence is in the file to which it relates; so, for example,\nBolehill Farm. Our records are on paper and in electronic form.\nWe therefore must refuse to process this request any further because it\nwould exceed the \u201cappropriate limit\u201d specified in section 12, which is\n\u00a3450 or 18 hours of officer time. You could consider refining your request\nto come within the cost of compliance. Could you consider narrowing your\nrequest to a particular subject or property or entity for a reasonable\nperiod? Could you make the request of the Charity Commission itself, which\nmay have their correspondence organised differently, i.e., by Trustee,\nwhich would be Sheffield City Council.\nWe are happy to otherwise consider a new request for information which\nwill strive to complete within the deadline.\nIf you are unhappy with the outcome of this internal review, you can ask\nthe Information Commissioner for a decision: [1][\nemail address\n]\nKind regards\nThis Email, and any attachments, may contain non-public information and is\nintended solely for the individual(s) to whom it is addressed.
