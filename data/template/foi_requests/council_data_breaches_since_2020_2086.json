Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our records\nto identify the type of data breach and how many people were affected in\neach case. We estimate that we would need to search over 1000 records and\nthat it would take 5 minutes to search each record. Therefore, it would\ntake us 83 hours to collate the information, which is more than the cost\nlimit of 18 hours or \u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and\nData Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No.\n3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters.
