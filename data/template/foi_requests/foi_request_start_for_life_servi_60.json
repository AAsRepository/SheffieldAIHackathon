                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI'm writing to ask the following questions under the Freedom of Information Act.\n1. How many babies were born in your local authority area from 1 April 2021 to 1 April 2023?\n2. How many babies do you estimate there are aged 0-2 living in your local authority area currently?\n3. What proportion of them accessed Start for Life services during the period 1 April 2022 to 1 April 2023?\n4. The Family Hubs and Start for Life programme guide states that 10% of babies have a \u2018disorganised\u2019 attachment style which is associated with the worst developmental outcomes. (see Annex I: perinatal mental health and parent\u2013infant relationship support on p81) What percentage of babies aged 0-2 in your Integrated Care System are you commissioning specialised parent-infant relationship services for? i.e. a clinical psychologist or child psychotherapist led service, as outlined here:\nhttps://parentinfantfoundation.org.uk/ou...\nYours faithfully,\nBen Curran"
