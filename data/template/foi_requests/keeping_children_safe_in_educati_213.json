                "Dear John Ormerod,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Keeping Children Safe In Education Statutory 2023 which we received on 15/10/2023.\nThis has been logged as a Freedom of Information Request and will be dealt with under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The reference number for your request is 944212.\nYou have asked us what information we hold relating to Keeping Children Safe In Education Statutory Guidance 2023 and we have requested information from Andrew Jones, Director of Education and Skills; Meredith Dixon-Teasdale, Strategic Director of Children's Services and Rosemary Ward, Strategic Commissioning Manager. They have all returned no information about this guidance. This is likely to be because this guidance is sent directly to the heads of schools and colleges and it is for them to implement rather than the council. Therefore, we are unable to answer your request as it has been put to us.\nIf we have not understood your request or you would like to submit a different or associated request, please contact us again.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
