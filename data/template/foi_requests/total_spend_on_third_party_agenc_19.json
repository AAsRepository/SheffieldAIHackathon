                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nI would like to know how much each primary, secondary and SEND schools within Sheffield City Council (of which data is held) has spent on Supply Teaching or Teaching Assistant cover with external companies, and how much has been spent with each of those companies per school, ideally. If this information is not available, then just a total spend by school. If this could be presented in excel it would be appreciated\nI would like this data from the 1st September 2023 - 31st July 2024 please?\nYours faithfully,\nMike Talbot"
