                "Dear Mr Buxton\nWe apologise for the third week running for failing to provide you with\nour internal review of your request for information regarding a judicial\nreview of South Yorkshire Police\n.\nYour original request was dated 28/10/22.\nWe replied on 25 November 2022, and you complained about our response on\n26 November 2022.\nWe gave you a deadline of 28 December 2022 by which time we proposed to\nprovide an internal review.\nOn 9 January 2023 we informed you that we had overlooked extending the\ndeadline for our response by a month, as we wanted to conduct a public\ninterest test for legally privileged information. Section 10 of the Act\nenables a public authority to do this \u2013 albeit before the deadline has\npassed.\nOn the new deadline of 26 January 2023, and then on 8 February 2023 via\nthe Chief Executive\u2019s office, we advised you of delays.\nToday, we cannot reply as this week has been half-term, which has slowed\neverything down. Our hope is that with the return to business as usual\nnext week, our response to you can be finalised.\nIt would be churlish to suggest that a further fortnight\u2019s extension\nbeyond 26 January 2023 because the request is complex, would have been\njustified, meaning a response today would only be a week late. So we are\nnot going to rely upon this provision in the section 45 Code of Practice\nregarding internal reviews.\nWhilst Robert Burns wrote that, \u201cA [person]\u2019s reach\u00a0should exceed his\ngrasp, or what's a heaven for\u201d, we would have to gently confirm that our\nhand can only hold so much at a time.

                "Dear Mr Buxton\nThank you for your request for an internal review relating to the proposal\nfor a Judicial review of South Yorkshire police, which we received on\n26/11/2022. We were due to reply by 28 December 2022 but postponed this\ndue to annual leave until 6 January 2023. On 9 January 2023 we said to you\nthat we had made a mistake by not extending the deadline under section 10\nof the Act by 20 working days, as we had legally privileged information,\nwhich required the application of the public interest test. Our new\ndeadline was 26 January 2023. We have kept you updated about our delays\nsince but apologise again for falling short of the legal requirement to\nanswer on time. This has been due to workloads.\nYour complaint was about our failure to locate any information relating to\na judicial review of South Yorkshire Police by Sheffield City Council; and\nto rely on an answer John Mothersole, the former chief executive, gave Sir\nMark Lowcock at a public hearing of the Independent Inquiry into the\nStreet Tree Dispute on 27 October 2022. Mr Mothersole told Sir Mark\nLowcock (about 69 minutes into his evidence) that when the idea was\nfloated of judicially review the police, arising from disquiet that they\nwere giving the council less attention than they had, he dismissed this\noption.\nWe accept your complaint. Our search was not comprehensive. We have\nlocated information, which is in scope.\nThis information is legally privileged under section 42(1) of the Act. The\ntype of privilege within the concept of legal professional privilege in\nthis information is advice privilege, which applies where no litigation is\nin progress or contemplated. It covers confidential communications between\nthe client and lawyer, made for the main purpose of seeking or giving\nlegal advice. This helps to ensure complete fairness in legal proceedings.\nThe client was the council.\nSection 42 is a qualified exemption, subject to the public interest test.\nThe council must consider whether the public interest in maintaining the\nexemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The general public\ninterest inherent in this exemption will always be strong due to the\nimportance of the principle behind LPP: safeguarding openness in all\ncommunications between client and lawyer to ensure access to full and\nfrank legal advice, which in turn is fundamental to the administration of\njustice.\nThe public interest in disclosing the information is the assumption in\nfavour of disclosure and the rationale behind the assumption (ie\naccountability, transparency, furthering public debate etc). The\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office advises that additional weight may be\nadded to this factor if either of these issues are relevant in the\nparticular case:\na large amount of money involved; a large number of people affected; lack\nof transparency in the public authority's actions. In this case, the\nadvice was sought from a barrister, as part of a range of legal advice the\ncouncil commissioned. There was no abnormal cost; it did not proceed so\ndid not affect a large number of people; but it is a matter of public\ninterest in the dispute about street trees. Sir Mark Lowcock did publicly\nreveal that there had been consideration of the idea in council circles.\nWe have therefore decided that on balance it is in the public interest to\ndisclose the information.\nWe have extracted this information from a \u2018Note on enforcing High Court\ninjunction\u2019 some legal advice provided by a barrister to SCC on 9 October\n2017.\n1. We have been asked to provide a note to the Council on how,\npractically, to enforce the injunction Orders granted by Males Jon 17\nAugust 2017.\n2. The brief background to this note is that, since 25 September 2017,\nprotestors have resumed carrying out direct action within safety zones.\nThis has frustrated tree-felling on a number of occasions. Where these\nindividuals are known to the Council and/or Amey, or can subsequently be\nidentified, committal applications have been or will be brought. There\nare, however, a number of examples of individuals entering safety zones\nwho have and will escape identification. There is also, to date, one\nexample of an individual within a safety zone wearing a mask. (1) We\nunderstand that there is real concern that Unknown Protestors will\ncontinue to disrupt tree-felling.\n3. To the extent that Unknown Protestors cannot be identified, it would be\nimpossible to issue committal proceedings against them in the High Court.\nIn respect of this category of protestors, therefore, the Council needs to\ntake extra steps. In light of how much money the Council has spent\nobtaining the injunction Orders, and in the event that other steps are\nineffective, we advise that at least one of the following extra steps must\nbe taken.\n4. These extra steps are:\na. Urging the police to arrest Unknown Protestors and, if that fails,\nsending a pre-action protocol letter to the police threatening a judicial\nreview of their decision not to arrest; and/or,\nb. Using reasonable force (whether Amey or the Council) to prevent Unknown\nProtestors from entering safety ones or removing Unknown Protestors\nalready within safety zones.\n(a) Escalating matters with the police\n5. We consider it essential that the Council steps up its communications\nwith the police and urges the police to make arrests. If necessary, the\nCouncil should threaten to bring judicial review proceeding against the\npolice.\n6. Previously, the police has said that it would not take action until the\ncivil process had been exhausted. The police had also variously said that\nno offences were being committed and/or there was no public interest in\nprosecution.\n7. The civil process has now been concluded - at great financial cost to\nthe Council - with a High Court injunction having been granted. Males J\nfound that those carrying out direct action are committing at least one\ncriminal offence: s303 of the Highways Act 1980. (2) Moreover, given the\nfindings of Males J, it would also follow that a criminal offence contrary\nto s241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992\nis being committed by the protestors.\n8. In this light, it is difficult to see how the police can justify its\nstance of inaction. This is in the circumstances that: (i) the High Court\nhas confirmed that the protestors are committing at least one criminal\noffence; (ii) the High Court has decided that direct action - and the harm\ncaused by it - exceeds the lawful ambit of the right to protest; and,\n(iii) notwithstanding the substantial reasons necessitating the High Court\ninjunction, its enforcement is proving difficult due to shortcomings in\nthe civil process.\n9. As a result, the factors previously relied upon by the police no longer\nstand up to scrutiny. The Council should urge upon the police, in no\nuncertain terms, that it must take action and that failure to do is an\nunlawful abdication of its duties and powers.\n10. In the event that the police refuses to take action, the Council\nshould prepare and serve a Pre-Action\nProtocol Letter. This would inform the police that the Council intends to\nbring judicial review proceedings against it unless action is taken.\n11. The Council's argument would be that:\ni. Protestors standing inside safety zones are committing criminal\noffences;\nii. The police has power to arrest them, pursuant to s24 of the Police and\nCriminal Evidence Act 1984;\niii. The police's policy decision of not arresting protestors within\nsafety zones is unlawful in that the police have failed to take into\naccount the relevant considerations that:\nThose carrying out direct action are committing criminal offences;\nThe direct action exceeds the lawful ambit of the right to protest; as\nfound by Males J, the conduct of the protestors cannot be justified in\nlight of the harm being caused to the public interest; and,\nThe Council cannot enforce the High Court injunction against Unknown\nProtestors; and,\niv. The High Court ought to grant a declaration to that effect.\n12. Unfortunately, it would be very unlikely for a court to order a police\nauthority to make these arrests: see, for example, R v Chief Constable of\nDevan and Cornwall ex p Central Electricity Generating Board [1982) QB 458\n(CA). Nonetheless, it is hoped that the threat of a judicial review, and\neven bringing the judicial review itself to obtain a declaration, would\nencourage the police to take action.\n(1) I will refer to these two types of protestors as \"Unknown Protestors\".\n(2) Paras 66-67 of his judgment.\nThis concludes our review.
