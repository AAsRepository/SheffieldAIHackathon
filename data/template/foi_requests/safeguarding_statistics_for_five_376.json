                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\n1. Purpose\n1.1. We would ask that you consider this Freedom of Information Act request as a positive exercise in assessing your own strengths and weaknesses as a Local Authority or Safeguarding board in ensuring fairness and compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998, particularly given that the consequences of making decisions that override the care arrangements that were in place before a Safeguarding Investigation can be devastating and destroy the lives of accused people, if they go wrong.\n1.2. Also, It is essential that Local Authorities/Social Work departments  and Safeguarding boards are recognising and acting on abuse despite a challenging financial backdrop for Local Authorities and Safeguarding boards.\n1.3. Cooperating with this Freedom of Information Act Request, which has been purposefully launched on the \u201cWhat Do They Know\u201d platform, not only assists me with managing responses from Local Authorities and Safeguarding boards across the United Kingdom, but it also allows a range of bodies, including the media and national government to assess the financial support available to Local Authorities which in turn hopefully will foster positive outcomes. It is also extremely useful for self-valuation and for comparison purposes between Local Authorities and Safeguarding Boards.\n1.4. It is also essential that Local Authorities and Safeguarding Boards are transparent in their dealings, given the significant powers afforded to Social Services and Safeguarding Boards, particularly given that the taxpayer/the general public (including the Local Authority and Safeguarding Boards\u2019s Employee/s/Volunteer/s answering the Freedom of Information Act Request are also taxpayers and Safeguarding concerns us all, in a private capacity with far-reaching consequences for those falsely accused or where malicious allegations occur.\n1.5. A lack of response or a lack of willingness to cooperate with this Freedom of Information Act Request, conversely, may cause the general public, the media and national government to form an adverse view of performance, fairness or compatibility with the Human Rights Act and in protecting vulnerable people from harm where the accused could as easily become equally as vulnerable as the purported victim of abuse was thought to be.\n1.6. We welcome your cooperation and thank you in advance for it.\n2. Rationale\n2.1. A = Children, B = Adults with Disabilities/Vulnerable Adults C = Older People (Shorthand A - C)\n2.2. Roman Numerals = Subcategorised Questions.\n2.3. Although I use the term \u201cSafeguarding\u201d, I appreciate that Local Authorities and Safeguarding Boards often differentiate between child protection and safeguarding investigations. As the fundamental aims and objectives are the same - to protect the vulnerable in all age groups, I collectively use the term \u201cSafeguarding\u201d to cover children, disabled and/or otherwise vulnerable adults and older people to reflect the overall subdivisions of Social Care.\n2.4. Questions regarding Social Workers and Managers should be considered not only to include those directly employed by your Local Authority/Local Authorities covered but also those volunteering, contracted, employed indirectly on a temporary basis or otherwise and by \u201cManager\u201d I mean anyone working in a Managerial capacity, such as Supervisors.\n2.5. The \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d describes the alleged perpetrator of abuse regardless of the stage or conclusion of the safeguarding investigation and regardless of outcome.\n2.6. The \u201calleged victim of abuse\u201d describes a person, regardless of the stage or conclusion of the safeguarding investigation and regardless of outcome.\n2.7. Where you are responding on behalf of a Safeguarding board, please specify the Local Authority areas covered and answer clearly for each Local Authority area. If you can\u2019t, please specify the Local Authority Areas covered and please provide combined figures as a last resort.\n2.8. Where your Local Authority/Safeguarding board is not subject to English and Welsh law (in Northern Ireland and Scotland or where Welsh devolved law is relevant), please specify legislation that applies where relevant to the question.\n2.9. Please always answer with the question number to aid in processing the results and please avoid answering questions with attachments as this makes it difficult for the results to be read.\n3. Scope\n3.1. Over the course of the last 5 years from 25 April 2024. or covering the nearest recent five year period that you have data for (Please specify your date range).\n--------\n***Section 1 \u2013 Total Numbers of Safeguarding Referrals***\n1.

Subcategorised by A \u2013 C, does your Local Authority or Safeguarding Board consider removing children, vulnerable adults/adults with disabilities or older people represents better value for money than arrangements for accommodation being made privately?\nNote: I recognise that this question might initially be perceived as contentious but it is also recognised that Local Authorities/Social Services act in the best interests of vulnerable people on extremely tight budgets against a backdrop of having a duty to protect vulnerable people.\n***Section 9 \u2013 Social Worker/Social Work Managers Performance/Training***\nNote: By \u201cSocial Work Manager\u201d this should be interpreted as including Social Work Supervisors employed by/contracted by your Local Authority / covered by the Local Authorities that you cover.\nIf the legislation does not apply to your Local Authority or Safeguarding Board (for example, for Respondents in Scotland and Northern Ireland and where devolved legislation applies, for example potentially in the case of Wales, please provide all legislation Social Workers and Social Work Managers are trained in, within the context of forced access (with or without assistance from the Police) and please reply in that context).\n1.

                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nPlease pass this on to the person who conducts Freedom of Information reviews.\nI am writing to request an internal review of Sheffield City Council's handling of my FOI request 'Safeguarding Statistics for Five Year Period From 25 April 2024 or Nearest 5 Year Period'.\n1. You have calculated that gathering this information will exceed the cost limit, but I believe that this is an overestimation of the resource required.\nThis is because not only does Sheffield City Council have a public sector equality duty in ensuring that all of it's operations comply in the interests of justice and equitability, but also more widely in ensuring compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998 (as amended) and as detailed within the FOI questions themselves.\nAs such, it would be impossible for Sheffield City Council to be able to ensure compatibility with human rights without being able to disseminate the data and it is reasonably forseeable that you would have the data in a form that is able to be scrutinised already.\nThe information requested is argued to have been duly over-calculated in terms of the cost of compliance with this Freedom of Information Request, unless of course Sheffield City Council has had no regard for human rights in it's activities.\n2. Information will be required to be reported to the NHS and the Department for Education. This will require a manual review of case files anyway as you assert that you are unable to provide any information.\nThis undermines the argument that a manual review of case files causes the cost threshold to be exceeded. The cost of collating this information is largely met by complying with your statistics reporting duties.\nIt is not fair, therefore, to consider that the cost of this work can be attributed to the Freedom of Information Act request to such an extent as you suggest because providing the information is simply a case of bringing forward an already required exercise and further investigation of those case files at the same time substantially reduces the cost averred by your local authority.\nThe fact that your response is issued within such close proximity to the deadline for a response to be issued, without any valid clarification request, is also indicative of the refusal being related to the fact that you have run out of time. Whilst you do have 20 working days from the day after the Freedom of Information Act request is received to reply, to take nearly 20 days to send what is largely a template letter is indicative of this response being used a convenient opt-out for compliance with the FOIA.\nI duly file an internal appeal.\nYours faithfully,\nAlex Hoskyn"
