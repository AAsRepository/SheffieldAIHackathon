Act 1949 (please note below is a\nbroken-down version of the Act from GRO guidance).\nVoid relationships \u2013 Part 1.9\nThe following list details relationships by blood or adoption which are\nnot permitted for marriage purposes and would make the marriage void:\nAdoptive child\nAdoptive parent\nChild\nFormer adoptive child\nFormer adoptive parent\nGrandparent\nGrandchild\nParent\nParent\u2019s sibling\nSibling\nSibling\u2019s child\nHalf-blood relationship is as much an impediment to marriage as whole\nblood relationship. The restrictions still apply if a person\u2019s parents\nwere not married to each other at the time of their birth.\n(Please note that we would not take a notice of marriage or civil\npartnership for any of the above details),\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
