Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our\nrecords. This would involve a review of the localities establishment and\nHR data for each month of the last 5 years. There would then be the social\nwork roles based in the Trust to consider, because whilst they work for\nthe Sheffield Health and Social Care Trust, they deliver our statutory\nduties. We estimate that it would take us a minimum of 37.5 hours to\ncollate the information, which is more than the cost limit of 18 hours or\n\u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data Protection\n(Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters.
