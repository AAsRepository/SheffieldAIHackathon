We\nendeavour to provide a response to internal reviews within 40 working\ndays. However, a review can sometimes be delayed and I apologise for this.\nI can now confirm that a full and impartial review of the decision made in\nthis case has been conducted with a summary as follows:\nYou contacted the Council on 4^th July 2023, requesting information\nrelating to memorial trees. The Council responded on the 1^st August 2023.\nincluded map hyperlinks that were inactive.\nYour email received by the Council on 5^th August 2023 explained that you\nwere requesting an internal review of the above response as the response\ndid not provide the information requested.\nI have reviewed the details of your complaint and have determined that the\nposition outlined in the original response provided should be not be\nupheld. A file is attached with the locations of the trees.\nFor your information when reviewing the maps, in the majority of the maps\nthe WW1 memorial tree is the one that is highlighted. Where this isn\u2019t the\ncase it has been made clear in title of the map. This usually occurs when\nthere is an avenue of trees and one of them isn\u2019t a WW1 memorial.\nThe 200 feathers and whips are shown in a polygon. The map says there are\n2100 trees in the polygon of which 200 are the memorial trees. The Council\nis unable to provide the exact location of these 200 trees within the\nwider group of 2100 trees.\nIf you are dissatisfied with my review, you can make a complaint to the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office: [1][\nemail address\n]\nYours sincerely,\nSheffield City Council\nPO Box 1283\nSheffield, S1 1UJ\nEmail: [2][Sheffield City Council request email]\nThis Email, and any attachments, may contain non-public information and is\nintended solely for the individual(s) to whom it is addressed.
