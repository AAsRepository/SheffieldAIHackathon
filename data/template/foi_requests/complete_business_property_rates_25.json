                "Dear J Talbot,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Complete Business\nProperty Rates Data which we received on 04/03/2025.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nWe publish some business rates information on our Open Data website at the\nfollowing link: [1]\nhttps://datamillnorth.org/dataset/scc-bu...\n.\nPlease note that the data we publish is limited and does not include all\nof the information you requested.\nIn case EA/2018/0055; Sheffield City Council vs Information Commissioner\nand Gavin Chait, the First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber)\nInformation Rights upheld the Council\u2019s appeal against the Information\nCommissioner\u2019s decision (decision notice FS50681336\n[2]\nhttps://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-tak...\n)\nthat the Council should publish this information. Consequently, the\nCouncil maintains that this information is exempt from disclosure for the\nfollowing reasons.\nSection 31 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000\nThe information you have requested is exempt from disclosure under section\n31(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on the grounds that\ndisclosure of this information would prejudice the prevention and\ndetection of crime. Disclosure of this information would involve releasing\nthe addresses of empty properties which could make the properties more\nvulnerable to criminal and anti-social activities. In particular, the\nCouncil believes that disclosure of the information could have the\nfollowing effects:\n\u2022\u00a0Disclosure would provide a ready-made list of empty properties which\ncould be used by criminals who could target empty properties to commit\nproperty crimes and fraud.\n\u2022\u00a0Release of information which is not easily available at present would\nbetter enable a fraudster to persuade the council that they were the\nratepayer. It would entail significant time and expense for the\nCouncil to alter its security system to protect against any potential\nfraud.\n\u2022\u00a0Disclosure of the information would make it easier for criminals to\ntarget empty properties in which waste could be dumped.\n\u2022\u00a0Release of information could be used to locate potential venues for\nillegal raves, which are also associated with other crimes such as\ncriminal damage in accessing the property, drug offences and public\norder offences.\n\u2022\u00a0A list of empty properties could be used by urban explorers to locate\nnew properties to explore and could lead to an increase in crimes\nassociated with urban exploring such as criminal damage to gain entry\n\u2022\u00a0Disclosure of a list of empty properties may lead to an increase in\ncrimes such as criminal damage, arson and anti-social behaviour, which\nare often associated with squatting.\nThere is a real and significant risk that fraud would be made easier by\nthe release of this information and that the provision of a readymade list\nof empty properties makes it easier for criminals to identify targets for\nthe crimes listed above. Therefore, disclosure would be likely to\nprejudice the prevention of crime.\nThis is a qualified exemption and requires a public interest test to\nconsider whether the public interest in maintaining the exemption\noutweighs the public interest in the disclosure of the information.\nPublic interest arguments in favour of disclosing the information\n\u2022\u00a0The disclosure of the information serves the general public interest\nin promotion of better government through transparency,\naccountability, public debate, better understanding of decisions, and\ninformed and meaningful participation of the public democratic\nprocess.\n\u2022\u00a0Researchers could use this data to contribute usefully to the general\ndebate in this area and therefore there is some public interest in its\nrelease.\n\u2022\u00a0A list of vacant commercial properties could be used by businesses\nlooking for development opportunities\nPublic interest arguments in favour of maintaining the exemption\n\u2022\u00a0The release of this information would make it much easier for a\nfraudster to pose as a ratepayer and bypass the Council\u2019s security\nsystems, and changing those systems would entail significant time and\nexpense. Disclosure would also facilitate a fraudster posing as the\nCouncil to obtain confidential information from a ratepayer. Rates\nfraud is a real and current problem and the consequences to the\nCouncil of a loss of a significant sum of public money are serious.\n\u2022\u00a0Urban exploring and illegal raves are a current problem in Sheffield\nand disclosure could contribute to this problem.\n\u2022\u00a0Disclosure may lead to an increase in other property crimes such as\ncriminal damage, arson and anti-social behaviour. Tackling issues like\nthese would involve significant public expense and it is in the public\ninterest to protect property and to ensure that public resources are\nused efficiently. There is also a compelling public interest in\navoiding personal distress to the direct victims of the crime and to\nthose in the wider neighbourhood who may be affected. Once an area is\nsubject to crime, it has an impact on the surrounding neighbourhood,\nreducing the value of neighbouring properties and the quality of life\nof the residents.\n\u2022\u00a0Research can be undertaken without the release of this data. There are\nother mechanisms for researchers to obtain the data, for example the\nuse of licensed research agreements, which do not involve disclosure\nof the information to the world at large.\n\u2022\u00a0There are already sources of information which can be used to identify\ndevelopment opportunities: some vacant properties are being actively\nmarketed, there is a list of vacant commercial properties on the\nBusiness Investment District list and information is available from\nthe town centre management scheme or planning officers.\nOn balance, the Council believes that the public interest in maintaining\nthe exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
