                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act 2000, I am requesting information regarding Section 60 costs under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (LRHUDA 1993), specifically those costs that have been passed on to leaseholders who have extended their leases where the council was the Competent Landlord.\nTo facilitate an analysis on the costs that leaseholders are liable when they extend their leases I would appreciate if you could provide the following data in a csv file with the following columns:\n1. Date of completion \u2013\u00a0YYYY/MM/DD\n2. Premium Paid \u2013\u00a0Integer\n3. Section 60 costs \u2013\u00a0Integer\nThis data should be provided for the most recent 100 lease extensions that have completed where the council was the Competent Landlord. If this is not deliverable in a single request could you return data for the largest number of requests possible. If you cannot provide all of the above within the scope mentioned above, please provide what available information you have and an explanation for why you cannot provide the data.\nI understand that under the Act, I should be entitled to a response within 20 working days of your receipt of this request. If it is not possible to provide the information requested due to the information exceeding the cost of compliance limits identified in Section 12, please provide advice and assistance, under your Section 16 obligations, as to how I can refine my request to be included in the scope of the Act.\nYour assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated, as it will contribute to a better understanding of the financial implications facing leaseholders when extending their leases under LRHUDA 1993.\nYours faithfully,\nJosef Wasinski"
