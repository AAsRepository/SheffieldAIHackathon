Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our\nrecords. The Licensing Service has received 1402 complaint from 1^st\nJanuary 2018 to date. These will mostly be in relation to taxi drivers,\nvehicles, and operators; however, a small number will be in relation to\nLicensed premises or other areas of licensing. We estimate that we would\nneed to search 1402 records and that it would take 30 minutes to search\neach record to identify and summarise each complaint. Therefore, it would\ntake us 701 hours to collate the information, which is more than the cost\nlimit of 18 hours or \u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and\nData Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No.\n3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. We may be able to produce a\nlist of complaints from 1^st January 2018 to date which would state the\ndate the complaint was received and a categorisation of the type of\ncomplaint it is (e.g. driving standards, driver attitude, vehicle\ncondition etc).
