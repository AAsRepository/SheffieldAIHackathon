                "Dear Marcus Combie,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Lowcock findings\nwhich we received on 09/12/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nWe apologise for missing the legal deadline for our response.\nYour request refers to a period where \u00a0Steve Eccleston was \u2018head of legal\u2019\nand Gillian Duckworth was \u2018head of governance\u2019.\u00a0 For clarity, Steve\nEccleston has never held that position, his role with Sheffield City\nCouncil was latterly Assistant Director Legal and Governance.\u00a0 Gillian\nDuckworth was Director of Legal and Governance from 2014.\u00a0 We have\ntherefore assumed that 2014 onwards is the relevant period for your\nrequest, please let us know if this is not correct.\nIn your request you state that the Lowcock Inquiry \u2018found the Council\nsubmitted misleading documents to the court\u2019.\u00a0 In fact the Inquiry noted\nthat the document in question was submitted by the other party to the\nproceedings and not by the Council.\u00a0 However, it is also clear that the\nCouncil made significant errors in relation to the document and we have\naccepted the Inquiry findings in full on this point, including through\nsubmitting an apology to the courts.\nTurning to your request.\u00a0 I am afraid, we do not know whether we hold\ninformation which might fall into the category you have identified. We are\nnot aware of any such investigations. The relevant period is over 10 years\nand across the Council we have been involved in many cases involving the\ncourts and the task of examining each file to look for the requested\ninformation would exceed the cost of compliance under section 12(2) of the\nAct. The cost limit of \u00a3450 is equivalent to 18 hours of officer time\nspecified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data Protection\n(Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No. 3244).\nOur case work is voluminous and extensive across a range of public\nservices. It would not be possible to undertake an assessment as to\nwhether any information was improperly submitted in legal proceedings\nwithin the time frame prescribed by the Act.\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. If you would like to narrow\ndown the focus of your request, we would be happy to process your revised\nrequest as a new request for information under the Freedom of Information\nAct 2000. You might consider whether you want to know if we have had any\ncomplaints for a specified period about our litigation to our corporate\ncomplaints process.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
