                "Dear FOI,\nThere have been a number of high risk domestic abuse cases being reported in the press recently, which has led to widespread debates around barriers to reporting abuse. Many victims who have children cite fear of childrens services as a barrier. A high number of those have felt let down by children\u2019s services and feel that social care viewed the victim as a risk to the child for \u201cfailure to protect\u201d especially if did not leave straight away or did not report some incidents straight away.\nThere appears to be a culture of placing responsibility on the victim and shifting away from the perpetrator and a clear lack of understanding from social care regarding the complexities of this issue and also the safety implications for leaving an abusive relationship.\nIn a high proportion of cases where the victim already has a child and enters into a relationship with a partner who also already has a child, and that later becomes abusive it is only the victims child subject to intrusive assessment and the perpetrators child is not. This leads victims to form a view that social care see them as the risk rather than the perpetrator and some even feel there is a victim blaming culture apparent.\nI have been informed of several cases where there has been a significant incident and it is only the victims child who has been subject to child protection measures, which seems to support the experiences of many victims.\nThis has been the case even when no children were present neither victims nor perpetrators. Very often a victims child will have no future ongoing contact with the victims child but will almost certainly continue to have some form of contact with their own.\nIn order to learn more about this matter I would like you to provide me with information on S47\u2019s carried out and if children living in other households are included eg when the perpetrator has other children with previous partners.\nIt would be helpful for specific numbers where this has or has not happened.\nAny information you could provide me with would be useful for my research.\nYours sincerely,\nLottie40"
