                "Dear Deepa Shetty,\nThank you for your request for information relating to planning\napplication procedure which we received on 22/07/2024.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nAt what juncture would a tree report and method statement for safeguarding\nmeasures* to be taken whilst working around large, mature trees - be\nformally requested from a contractor applying to carry out works within a\nConservation Area?\nThis is considered to be more of a request for general advice as to how\nthe service operates rather than a specific information request.\nPlease note that this is a very broad hypothetical question that would\ndepend upon the specifics of a particular case (i.e. each case on its\nmerits which is an imbedded principle when it comes to the assessment of\nplanning applications).\nWithin the planning process it is rare that applications are received\ndirectly from contractors. Usually, applications are made by private\nindividuals or developers. The applicant is referred to as the applicant,\nbut often applications are submitted by representatives that have been\nappointed by an applicant who are known as agents in the process.\nYour question does not distinguish between whether the form of works\nproposed would be forms of operational development requiring planning\npermission, or whether the works referred to are specific tree works to\ntrees within a Conservation Area which do not involve any forms of\noperational development as well.\nWe would advise that there is an application type for both, although with\nthe former tree works can be assessed as part of the application for\nplanning permission without the need for an additional application only\nfor the tree works which would be superfluous.\nIf a large mature tree within a Conservation Area was in close proximity\nto a form of operational development that requires planning permission the\nvariables would depend upon the specific development proposal in question,\nthe proximity to the tree and its anticipated root protection area.\nFor something like a new building, it is likely that a tree survey and\nimpact assessment conforming to British Standard 5837: 2012 would be\nrequested either at validation or assessment stages prior to the decision\nbeing made. If a proposal is judged acceptable leading to the granting of\nplanning permission, it is then commonplace that conditions are imposed\nrequiring tree protection measures to be installed prior to works\ncommencing and for the duration of the construction period.\nHowever, for smaller scale works there would be a number of variables and\nthe information requirements and conditions would depend on the\ncircumstances involved with proportionality being a factor. As a service\nplanning would consult with the Council\u2019s specialist Landscaping Officers\non relevant proposals in order to receive guidance on whether trees would\nbe likely to be impacted by the works proposed, the type of information\nthat should be sought from applicants and on the need for specific\nconditions as part of the assessment process prior to the decision being\nmade.\nIn addition, there are various forms of operational development that can\nbe undertaken without any form of planning permission by virtue of the\nnational permitted development rights that are set out within The Town and\nCountry Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as\namended). For works which are permitted development the Council has no\npower to request information on safeguarding measures for existing trees\nin Conservation Areas. However persons wishing to carry out such permitted\ndevelopment works are still bound by section 211 of the Town and Country\nPlanning Act 1990:- [1]Town and Country Planning Act 1990\n(legislation.gov.uk)\nIf a planning application was found to have been misleading with respect\nto the works to be carried out within a Conservation Area, what is the\nprocedure in terms of rectification. At what juncture would a request be\nmade for works to be halted and the application resubmitted?\n*Protective measures might include British Standard 5837 recommendations,\nfor example. Avoiding compaction and excavation within the root protection\narea (RPA), unless directly under arboricultural supervision e.g. if large\nroots are discovered and requiring specialist instruction on how to\nproceed without impacting the health of the tree.\nPlease note that this is a very broad hypothetical question that would\ndepend upon the specifics of a particular case.\nInitially the process would rely upon a complaint being registered with\nthe Planning Enforcement service:-[2]Reporting a planning enforcement\nissue | Sheffield City Council\nPlanning Enforcement would then investigate the complaint to understand\nwhether there is a breach of the planning permission.\nIf so, there is a range of ways of tackling alleged breaches of planning\ncontrol, and local planning authorities should act in a proportionate way.\nLocal planning authorities have discretion to take enforcement action,\nwhen they regard it as expedient to do so having regard to the development\nplan and any other material considerations. The national guidance on the\nprocesses we are required to follow is available publicly using the\nfollowing weblink:- [3]Enforcement and post-permission matters - GOV.UK\n(www.gov.uk)\nIf the enforcement investigation finds that works are being carried out in\naccordance with a particular planning permission the options available to\nLocal Planning Authority\u2019s are fairly limited in that we do not have the\npower to withdraw a permission unilaterally without the payment of\ncompensation. For that reason, the powers under S97 of the Town and\nCountry Planning Act are very rarely used by LPA\u2019s throughout the Country.\n[4]\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/199...\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
