                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nThis is a request for all the information I am entitled to under the Freedom of Information Act. If this request is too wide or unclear, please contact me in the first instance as under section 16 of the Act, public authorities are required to advise and assist requesters. If the requested information cannot be provided within the time and cost limit for all the years specified, please narrow this down to fewer years.\nThe independence of scrutiny committees and audit committees has been identified in a number of Public Interest Reports as being an important factor in facilitating meaningful scrutiny and challenge within local authorities.\nAs audit committees are not formally treated as part of scrutiny it may be that they are treated differently in the council\u2019s constitution and policies. Please clarify which committee type your response relates to.\na) Policy on Selection & Appointment of Committee Chairs\nPlease provide the council\u2019s current policy on selection and appointment of scrutiny committee chairs and audit committee chairs.\nb) Current Political Configuration of Committee Chairs\nPlease provide a figure showing what percentage of current scrutiny and audit committee chairs are members of an opposition party to the main controlling party or controlling coalition.\nI understand I should receive a response within 20 working days.\nYours faithfully,\nDon Mort\nOn behalf of Research for Action"
