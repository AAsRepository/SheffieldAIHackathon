                "Dear Bill Ellson,\nThank you for your request for information relating to responses to\nInformation Requests which we received on 02/10/2023.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\n1. The number of Information Requests by the Council received in July\n2023.\n167 requests were opened in July 2023.\n2. The number of said Information Requests received in July 2023, that the\ncouncil has either provided information in respect of, or confirmed it\ndoes hold the information, or confirmed the information held is exempt\nfrom disclosure, if any.\nInformation Not Held: 11.\nInformation provided: 89.\nInformation exempted: 22.\n(Withdrawn/duplicate: 3)\n3. The number of Council staff, if any, that have received any external\ntraining in complying with the Freedom of Information Act and the\nEnvironmental Information Regulations.\nThe information you have requested is exempt from disclosure under section\n12 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Sheffield City Council does\nhold the information you have requested. However, we do not record the\ninformation in a format that allows us to produce an electronic report of\nthis. Therefore, we would have to carry out a manual search of our\nrecords. We estimate that we would need to search at least the records of\n315 staff and that it would take 5 minutes to search each record. These\nstaff are our FOI Service Contacts and legal services staff, which have\nCPE/D points to earn each year. We would need to gather information about\nexternal webinars put on by solicitors' firms, either free or part of our\ncontract, and seminars put on by FOI trainers and commercial\norganisations, which we know our staff watch. Then there are the training\nvideos for new case officers on the ICO website, which our staff are\nencouraged to view. Finally, there are the paid for courses from the likes\nof Act Now, 2040 Training and PDP to mention a few, which we know staff\nhave attended. For instance, our last face to face training with an\nexternal trainer was all day with 35 staff. Therefore, it would take us 26\nhours to collate the information, which is more than the cost limit of 18\nhours or \u00a3450 specified in the [1]Freedom of Information and Data\nProtection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No.\n3244).\nUnder section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have a duty to\nprovide advice and assistance to requesters. If you would like to narrow\ndown the focus of your request, we would be happy to process your revised\nrequest as a new request for information under the Freedom of Information\nAct 2000.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [2]here.
