                "Dear Sheffield City Council,\nCIPFA Guidance on Local Authority Audit Committees states that \u201cRecommended practice is for audit committees to review and assess themselves annually or to seek an external review.\u201d\nWe realise that the committee with audit related responsibilities are not always called \u2018Audit Committee\u2019. Please can you confirm what the title of this committee is within your local authority and answer the following questions in relation to that committee.\na) Internal Annual Review of Audit Committee\nFor each of the last five financial years please provide me with a copy of the audit committee\u2019s annual review of its work. Please state the date the review was published and how it was made public at the time.\nb) External Review of Audit Committee\nPlease confirm the most recent date that an external review of the audit committee was sought, who undertook that review, when and where it was published and provide a copy of the review.\nYours faithfully,\nMegan Waugh\nResearch for Action"
