We endeavour to provide a response to internal reviews within 20\nworking days. However, a review can sometimes be delayed and I apologise\nfor the considerable amount of time you have had to wait for a response to\nbe provided.\nI can now confirm that a full and impartial review of the decision made in\nthis case has been conducted with a summary as follows:\nYou contacted the council on 20^th January 2023 with the following\nrequest:\nPlease supply the following information:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For 16/03443DEXRG, Please supply all documents (both email,\npaper, digital) for this application, for example copies of application,\narchitect plans, safety certificates re the quality of the building work,\nsurveyors report/assessment of building regulation standard for the\nextensions ie were they assessed specifically for suitable noise\ninsulation (across all walls, floors and ceilings of rooms adjoining party\nwalls (including the extension and main house) given size of extensions\nand open plan modification.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please supply any internal planning department documents\n(email, written, digital, notes of meetings) that exist in relation to\nthis reference 16/03443DEXRG, and which may not have been included in part\none above. Please include any documentation on decision making and factors\nthat were taken into consideration (for example, (but not an exhaustive\nlist) checks on sound proofing, building over drains, moving of\nwaste/sewage pipes and approvals from a relevant organisation to tap into\nthe main drainage etc).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to giving retrospective approvals in this case, was\nthere a consultation with the impacted neighbours (sharing the party\nwalls), to discuss quality/noise impacts or any other such concerns.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Was there any declaration of interest between any officials\ninvolved in the approval/assessment and decision making in this case and\nthe householders or their wider family circle?\nI have reviewed your complaint and have determined that firstly, your\ninformation request should have been logged under the Environmental\nInformation Regulations. Secondly, the Council is in breach of the Code of\nPractice which requires a response to an internal review within 40 days\nand we have taken almost a year to reply. We sincerely apologise for this\nbut we have had a significant backlog of requests that is taking us a long\ntime to get through.\nI am pleased to attach a number of documents that Sheffield City Council\nhold on the matter.\nPlease note that personal data has been redacted under Regulation 12(3) of\nthe Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) and Regulation 13 EIR\nas amended by Sch. 19, para 307 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which\nprovide an exception for where the information requested includes personal\ndata of which the applicant is not the data subject where disclosure would\ncontravene the data protection principles of the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). Disclosure of the information would contravene the data\nprotection principle under Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection\nRegulation that processing of personal data must be fair, lawful and\ntransparent.\n12(5)(e) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) provides\nan exception for the confidentiality of commercial information where such\nconfidentiality is provided by law to protect a legitimate economic\ninterest. The information is subject to confidentiality provided by law.\nThere is a duty of confidence that the council owes those submitting\nbuilding control applications.\nRegulation 12(5)(e) is subject to the public interest test set out at\nregulation 12(1)(b). Therefore, the Council must consider whether, in all\nthe circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the\nexception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the withheld\ninformation.\nFurthermore, regulation 12(2) of the EIR requires a public authority to\napply a presumption in favour of disclosure when relying on any of the\nregulation 12 exceptions.\nThe public interest in disclosure is transparency and accountability.\nThe public interest in withholding the information is the harm to the\ncommercial interests of Sheffield City Council and to the general public\nwho may disengage with the process if they believe their confidentiality\nis broken when they submit an application under Building Regulations.\nThe public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public\ninterest in disclosure. This is because, the withheld information retains\na commercial sensitivity, and it would not be in the public interest for\ninformation to be disclosed which would prejudice the Council\u2019s efforts to\nachieve a fair and competitive tender process. A Building Control\napplication is submission between the applicant and the authority and\nunlike Planning Applications are not within the public domain.\nIn reaching this decision we have relied upon the guidance from the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO). The ICO is the independent\nregulator of public authorities application of information rights law.
