                "Dear Lydia Monks,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Forge Dam\nRestoration Project which we received on 31^st July 2023. We apologise for\nthe significant delay in responding to your request. This was an oversight\non our part.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request set out\nbelow:\nWe are refusing your request under Regulation 12(4)(b) of the\nEnvironmental Information Regulations 2004 on the grounds that it would be\nmanifestly unreasonable to comply with the request. We have received six\nrequests on the same topic within a six-week period and this is one of the\nindicators for deciding a request is \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019.\nIn addition, we consider it will exceed the cost of compliance which it is\naccepted amounts to \u00a3450 or 18 hours of officer time. The provision of\ncorrespondence between the Friends of the Porter Valley and Sanctus, with\nSheffield City Council will be time-consuming. We would need to locate the\ninformation, retrieve and extract it. Thereafter we would have to put it\ninto chronological format and then redact the personal data of the\ncorrespondents. You may recall that we refused a similar request from you\non these same grounds.\nRefusing a request as \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 does not imply that the\nrequestor is acting maliciously: it is the term used in the regulations to\ncover requests that are excessive and place an unreasonable burden on\nresources. We believe this request fits the criteria set out by the\nInformation Commissioner [1]When can we refuse a request for environmental\ninformation? | ICO\nRegulation 12(4)(b) is subject to a public interest test. Factors in\nfavour of disclosure are that disclosure promotes openness and\ntransparency and helps citizens to understand actions taken by the local\nauthority.\nFactors in favour of maintaining the exception are that it is not in the\npublic interest to spend such a large amount of officer time on providing\nthis information, as this would come at a large cost to the council and\nwould divert officers from being able to carry out other work. On balance,\nthe council believes it is a distraction from the core duties of the\ncouncil and that the public interest lies in maintaining the exception.\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0. The terms of the OGL can be\nfound [1]here. When re-using the information, Sheffield City Council\nrequires you to include the following attribution statement: \u201cContains\npublic sector information obtained from Sheffield City Council and\nlicensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.\u201d\nIf you are unhappy with the response you have received in relation to your\nrequest, you are entitled to have this reviewed. You can ask for an\ninternal review by replying to this email. Internal review requests should\nbe submitted within 40 working days from the date of this response.\nIf you remain dissatisfied with the outcome of your internal review, you\ncan contact the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.
