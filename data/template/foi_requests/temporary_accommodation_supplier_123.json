                "Dear sir or madam,\nThis is a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\nPlease can you provide the following information relating to the Council\u2019s provision of temporary accommodation:\n1.\tThe total spend on temporary accommodation by private sector supplier in the 2023/24 financial year (01/04/2023 to 31/03/2024), categorised as follows:\n-\tPrivate sector accommodation leased by the local authority.\n-\tNightly paid, privately managed accommodation, self-contained.\n-\tBed and breakfast hotels (including shared annexes). I.e., not self-contained.\nNote: If it is too time consuming and costly to break down the spend into these three categories, then please just provide the total for each private sector supplier. To be clear, I am asking for both the name of the supplier and the total spend. Ideally, the suppliers would be arranged according to which of the three categories of accommodation they provide.\n2.\tPlease can you provide the total number of current temporary accommodation placements in other local authority districts, broken down according to the name of the local authority district the placements have been made in.\nPlease provide the information in one excel spreadsheet (it may contain more than one tab if necessary). Please supply the information relating to part 1 of the request in two columns, one with the provider\u2019s business name and one with the total spend over the period. Please supply the information relating to part 2 in two columns, one with the name of the relevant authority and one with the total temporary accommodation placements in that authority\u2019s district.\nI would like to confirm in advance that I am making this request on my own behalf, for my own use, and not for any organisation or other person.\nPlease can I also remind you of the duty under section 16 to provide reasonable advice and assistance to find the information available based on the above request.\nThank you \u2013 I look forward to your response within the standard 20 working days.\nStephen Hurford"
