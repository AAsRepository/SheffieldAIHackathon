In particular, I would like to know how much Glyphosate has been used by each of the different departments that use it under the auspices of the council, each calendar year from 2019 to the present. I believe Glyphosate is used by Streets Ahead, Housing, Parks, Bereavement and Education but there may be other departments that use it. Please include the data for all of them.\nI am aware that Glyphosate is sometimes purchased ready-diluted.

I requested that you put this in a table but you have not done this and I don't understand what the different figures are. I need to be able to compare the figures so I can tell if the actual quantity of undiluted Glyphosate is going up or down. You have set it out clearly for Bereavement Services. Please can you do the same for Parks?\nYours sincerely,\nGraham Wroe"
