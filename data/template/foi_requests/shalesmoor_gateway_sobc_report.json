                "Dear Mackenzie Key,\nThank you for your request for information relating to Shalesmoor Gateway\nSOBC which we received on 02/01/2024.\nPlease find Sheffield City Council\u2019s response to your request below:\nThank you for your request.\u00a0 For clarity, although the Outline Business\nCase (OBC) was initially submitted in September 2022, the version of the\nOBC is not suitable for publication until the Department for Transport\n(DfT) have completed their assurance process.\u00a0There are a number of\noutstanding technical questions that are in the process of being\naddressed, (there have been a number of iterations of additional questions\ntoo, in part due to changes in staff within the assurance process), so\nchanges to the submission documents are still being undertaken.\nUntil the DfT confirm that their questions have been answered, the OBC is\nstill in draft form and not suitable for publication.\u00a0 The assurance\nprocess with the DfT can be a long process and it is not uncommon for\nschemes of this scale to be considered for a lengthy period of time.\nThis information has been withheld under Regulation 12(4)(d) of the\nEnvironmental Information regulations 2004 (EIR) on the grounds that that\nthe information consists of material, which is still in the course of\ncompletion, to unfinished documents or to incomplete data. This exception\nis subject to a public interest test. Factors in favour of disclosure are\nthat disclosure promotes openness and transparency. Factors in favour of\nmaintaining the exception are that the Council needs a safe space in which\nit can develop ideas, debate live issues, and reach decisions away from\npublic scrutiny. On balance, the Council believes that the public interest\nlies in maintaining the exception.\nTo give you comfort, as soon as the SOBC has been accepted by the DfT, we\nwill publish the OBC and its supporting appendices.\nWe appreciate you have waited a long time for this, but unfortunately\napproval processes can sometimes take longer than expected.\nIn the meantime, if you have any specific questions, please feel free to\ncontact [1][\nemail address\n].\nIf you have any queries about this response, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nThe information provided in this response is available for re-use under\nthe terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0.
